Predstavlja \nvrtoglavicu koja se najčešće sreće u kliničkoj praksi. \nCilj ovog narativnog revijalnog rada je bio da ukaže na \nnajnovije smernice i da predstavi najvažnije informacije \nvezane za blagovremeno postavljanje dijagnoze i lečenje \npacijenata sa ovom formom vrtoglavice. Prikazane \nsu etiologija, patofiziologija, klinička slika, potom i \nmodaliteti postavljanja dijagnoze i najefikasniji vidovi \nlečenja. Dat je i kratak pregled rezultata iz istraživanja \nkoje je sprovedeno u našoj zemlji o familijarnosti \nkliničara sa smernicama i njihovom primenjivanju. Kako \nbismo izbegli kasno postavljanje dijagnoze, kašnjenje \nu lečenju i dodatne troškove dijagnostičkih procedura \ni pregleda, neophodno je formulisati strategiju na \nnacionalnom nivou i stalno edukovati studente \nmedicine, lekare opšte medicine, kao i lekare drugih \nspecijalnosti o ovom poremećaju i načinima njegovog \nlečenja.\nKljučne reči: BBPV, kupulolitijaza, kanalolitijaza, \npozicioni test, smerniceUvod\nBenigna paroksizmalna poziciona vrtoglavica je najčešći \nvid periferne vrtoglavice koji se sreće u svakodnevnoj klini- \nčkoj praksi. Iako je opisana ranije u stručnoj literaturi, posta-\nla je široko poznata sredinom devedesetih godina XX veka, \nkada su Alain Semont u Evropi i John Epley u Sjedinjenim \nAmeričkim Državama popularizovali ovaj poremećaj, kao i \nmetode njegovog lečenja1, 2.\nBPPV predstavlja formu pozicione vrtoglavice koja se \nkarakteriše kratkim periodičnim epizodama vrtoglavice, \nizazvane promenama u položaju glave i abnormalnom sti-\nmulacijom kupule, jednog od tri polukružna kanala u unu-\ntrašnjem uvu, najčešće zadnjem3. Tradicionalno, termin „be-\nnigna“ ukazuje na to da ovaj tip vrtoglavice nije povezan sa \nozbiljnijim poremećajem perifernog i centralnog nervnog \nsistema i da ima povoljne izglede za potpun oporavak4. Na-\nime, kod 20% pacijenata BPPV prolazi spontano tokom jed-\nnog meseca praćenja, a kod 50%, nakon tri meseca trajanja \ntegoba3. Dalje, termin „paroksizmalna“ u ovom kontekstu \nopisuje brzi, iznenadni i nepredvidivi početak napada vrto-\nglavice, koji se javlja u bilo kom trenutku, promenom polo-\nžaja glave u odnosu na zemljinu težu („poziciona“)5.\nBPPV kao najčešća vestibulološka dijagnoza, tokom ži-\nvota ima ogroman zdravstveni i socioekonomski značaj. \nProcenjuje se da troškovi zdravstvene zaštite, samo da bi se \npostavila dijagnoza BPPV u SAD iznose oko 2.000 dolara i \nda više od 65% pacijenata sa ovim stanjem, pre postavljanja \nispravne dijagnoze, obavi i neka nepotrebna dijagnostička \ntestiranja ili lečenja6. Procenjuje se da između 17-42% svih \npacijenata sa vrtoglavicom ima u osnovi BPPV i da se ona \njavlja bar jednom kod svih osoba starijih od 70 godina4. Pro-\nsečna starost na početku javljanja je 50 godina, a vrhunac \nincidencije je između 50 i 70 godina starosti5. Ukupna preva-\nlencija idiopatske BPPV se kreće od 10,7 do 140 na 100.000 \nljudi godišnje, povećava se za oko 38% za svaku deceniju \nživota i dvostruko je češća kod žena nego kod muškaraca7.\nKako se BPPV češće javlja kod starijih osoba koje ima-\nju i druge pridružene bolesti i stanja, njihov kvalitet života \nje dodatno narušen. U jednoj studiji je zabeleženo da oko \n9% gerijatrijskih pacijenata koji prolaze detaljnije fizikalno \nispitivanje zbog drugih tegoba ima u stvari neprepoznat \nBPPV8. Stariji pacijenti sa BPPV imaju veću učestalost pado-\nva, razvoja depresije i narušavanja njihovih svakodnevnih \n80 DOI: 10.5937/Galmed2308080B\naktivnosti. Stalna i nelečena vrtoglavica kod starijih pacije-\nnata vodi većem opterećenju negovatelja, tj. članova poro-\ndice, vodeći većim troškovima, smanjenoj produktivnosti i \nvećoj učestalosti smeštaja u ustanove za negu starijih lica.\nPoznati etiološki uzroci\nU inicijalnom opisu ovog poremećaja, od strane Mar-\ngaret Diks i Halpika (Dix-Hallpike), uzrok BPPV nije mogao \nbiti pronađen u 34-86% slučajeva i ti slučajevi su nazvani \nidiopatski, tj. primarna BPPV9. Kod idiopatske BPPV, koja se \nsve češće javlja sa starenjem, oslobađanje otokonija je vero-\nvatno povezano sa degeneracijom otolitnih organa. Faktori \nrizika koji mogu dovesti do inicijalne epizode BPPV uklju-\nčuju i prolongirano mirovanje (ležanje u krevetu), savijanje \nunapred spuštene glave, opštu anesteziju (zbog položaja u \nkome se pacijent nalazi tokom intubacije: položaj supinacije, \nsa glavom i vratom u ekstenziji, pri čemu se spušta otvor \nzadnjeg polukružnog kanala i olakšava ulazak otokonija \nu njega)10. Pored toga, neke bolesti ili patološka stanja11-19 \nmogu biti udruženi sa pojavom BPPV i tada se ona smatra \nsekundarnom (tabela 1).\nPatofiziološki aspekti BPPV\nOtokonije predstavljaju kristale kalcijum karbonata koji \nsu uronjeni u makulu kesice (utrikulusa) i vrećice (sakulu-\nsa) u čulu za ravnotežu u unutrašnjem uvu. One su veće \ngustine nego endolimfa koja ih okružuje, samim tim čine \nmakulu osetljivom na promene u linearnom ubrzanju, i što \nje još važnije, na naginjanje, tj. silu gravitacije. Polukružni \nkanali, sa druge strane, su osetljivi na promene u ugaonom \nubrzanju. Kod BPPV, smatra se da se otokonije iz utrikulusa \nnakupe u polukružnim kanalima, čineći ih tako neuobičaje-\nno osetljivim na gravitaciju. To dovodi do toga da bilo kakva \npromena položaja glave u odnosu na zemljinu težu rezultira \nabnormalnom stimulacijom kupule i odgovarajućih vestibu-\nlarnih aferenata, što se klinički manifestuje kao nenormalan \npokret oka i vrtoglavica. \nDo sada su opisane dve teorije kako se ovo može desiti: \nteorija kupulolitijaze i teorija kanalolitijaze. Teorija kupuloli-\ntijaze pretpostavlja da degenerativno izmenjene otokonije Stanja i oboljenja koja mogu dovesti do BPPV Učestalost u (%) Napomena\nNakon vestibularnog neuritisa11, 129,80 - 15,30\nMenierova bolest132,00 - 30,00\nPovreda glave14, 1514,50 - 18,00\nOsteoskleroza, osteopenija16, 17kod žena, nakon menopauze\nNakon stapedotomije18do 51,00\nUdruženo sa vestibularnom migrenom19\nUdruženo sa progresivnim gubitkom kohlearne i vestibularne funkcije5vestibularna ishemija i drugi vestibularni poremećajiTabela 1. Uzroci sekundarne BPPVotpadnu i zalepe se za kupulu, čineći je tako osetljivom na \nsilu gravitacije, dok teorija kanalolitijaze smatra da otokoni-\njalni debris slobodno pliva u endolimfi i da prilikom izlože-\nnosti gravitaciji menja pritisak endolimfe i izaziva posledič-\nno pomeranje kupule20.\nBPPV se ubedljivo najčešće javlja u zadnjem polukruž-\nnom kanalu, u preko 85% slučajeva (p-SCC), pa potom u ho-\nrizontalnom (h-SCC) od 5 do 10%, dok je u prednjem kanalu \nnajređa21, u manje od 2%. Treba naglasiti da BPPV može \nzahvatiti više kanala istovremeno, i da poremećaj može biti \nobostran. \nPostoji nekoliko potencijalnih objašnjenja zašto otpale \notokonije iz utrikulusa imaju tendenciju da upadaju u zadnji \npolukružni kanal. Smatra se da važnu ulogu imaju anato- \nmski faktori kao što su: veličina zajedničkog spojnog kanala \nzadnjeg i prednjeg kanala, njegova direktna pozicija ispod \nutrikulusa kada je telo u položaju supinacije i promena nje-\ngove pozicije pri ustajanju. \nDijagnoza i diferencijalna dijagnoza\nTipična klinička slika p-BPPV podrazumeva rotatornu \nvrtoglavicu koja traje nekoliko sekundi, može biti praćena \nmučninom i nestabilnošću prilikom ležanja, uspravljanja iz \nležećeg u sedeći položaj, okretanja u krevetu ili pri savijanju, \nili zabacivanju glave unazad. Ovi simptomi se obično javljaju \nu nekoliko napada tokom dana. Između napada ili nakon \nlečenja, pacijenti mogu biti potpuno bez simptoma ili mogu \nosećati nestabilnost i nesigurnost pri kretanju (pacijenti \nosećaj nestabilnosti opisuju kao „hodanje po mekanom“; \n„kao da sam malo popio“, osećaju se kao da propadaju, \ntonu, itd.).\nPostavljanje dijagnoze ovog poremećaja je veoma je- \ndnostavno. Dovoljno je pitati pacijenta da li mu se vrtogla-\nvica javlja prilikom zabacivanja glave, saginjanja, leganja \nili ustajanja, ili prilikom okretanja u krevetu. Ukoliko je od-\ngovor potvrdan, treba izvesti odgovarajući pozicioni test. \nDix-Hallpike test se izvodi za zadnji kanal postavljanjem paci-\njenta iz sedećeg u ležeći položaj, pri čemu je glava okrenuta \nza 45 stepeni i nalazi se ispod ravni kreveta pri leganju. Roll \ntest se izvodi za horizontalni kanal okretanjem glave paci-\njenta u stranu, pri čemu on leži na leđima na uzglavlju koje \nSMJERNICE I PREPORUKE 81 Galenika Medical Journal, 2023; 2(8):80-84.\nje uzdignuto za 30 stepeni. Test treba izvesti i sa leve i sa \ndesne strane da se ne bi propustio bilateralni poremećaj5. \nPozicioni nistagmus (Positional nystagmus, PN) koji se tom \nprilikom može javiti je torziono-vertikalni (zadnji kanal) ili \nhorizontalni (lateralni kanal), ima latenciju od nekoliko se-\nkundi i ograničenog je trajanja (10-20 s). Takođe, PN menja \nsmer ukoliko pacijent naglo zauzme sedeći položaj. Pri izvo-\nđenju testova mogu se koristiti i Frenzelove naočare, da bi \nse što bolje video nistagmus ili se može koristiti video-oku-\nlografija. Kako BPPV ponekad može postojati i sa drugim \nvestibularnim dijagnozama, anamneza pacijenta nekada \nmože biti nekarakteristična, pa se većina kliničara slaže da \nDix-Hallpike test treba izvoditi u sklopu svakog vestibulološ-\nkog ispitivanja. Dalja testiranja ili dijagnostičke procedure \nnisu potrebne kod pacijenata koji ispunjavaju kliničke krite-\nrijume za dijagnozu BPPV5, 22.\nPo pitanju diferencijalne dijagnoze, u obzir dolaze sva \noboljenja i stanja navedena u tabeli 1, koja, u krajnjoj instan-\nci, mogu dovesti do sekundarne BPPV. Slučajevi vrtoglavice \nkoje kliničar treba da razlikuje od BPPV uključuju otološke, \nneurološke i druge uzroke. Od otoloških dijagnoza najče-\nšće su: Menierova bolest, vestibularni neuritis, sindrom \ndehiscencije gornjeg polukružnog kanala, itd. Što se tiče \nneuroloških dijagnoza koje treba imati u vidu, to su: vesti-\nbularna migrena, vertebrobazilarna insuficijencija, demi-\njelinizirajuće lezije i druge lezije centralnog nervnog siste-\nma. Ukoliko je prisutan atipičan nistagmus pri pregledu ili \npacijent ispoljava cerebelarne znake ili znake zahvaćenosti \nmoždanog stabla, kao i ukoliko se poziciona vrtoglavica ne \nreši ponavljajućim repozicionim manevrima, neophodan je \nimaging zadnje lobanjske jame da bi se isključila centralna \npatologija.\nLečenje BPPV\nLečenje repozicionim manevrima (Canal Repositioning \nProcedure, CRP) u velikoj većini slučajeva akutnog p-BPPV i \nh-BPPV je uspešno (preko 90%)6, 23. Najuspešniji repozicio-\nni manevar za lečenje p-BPPV je Epley24, a za h-BPPV je tzv. \nBarbecue, odnosno Lempert manevar25. U manje od 10% \nslučajeva potrebna su dva ili tri manevra da bi došlo do \npotpunog prestanka tegoba. Pomenuti manevri su veoma \njednostavni za izvođenje, a mogu se izvoditi i kao deo vežbi \nu kućnim uslovima. Terapija lekovima nije indikovana, osim \nukoliko pacijenti imaju izraženu mučninu i povraćanje5. Na-\nžalost BPPV često recidivira nakon prve epizode vrtoglavice \nsa stopom recidiva između 15% i 50%, a naredna epizoda se \nobično javlja za nekoliko meseci4, 26.\nOsvrt na najnovije kliničke smernice\nU zavisnosti od organizacije zdravstvene službe u ra-\nzličitim zemljama, dijagnostikom i lečenjem BPPV se bave \nrazličite medicinske specijalnosti, od lekara opšte prakse, \npreko otorinolaringologa, neurologa, specijalista interne medicine do fizioterapeuta27. Nažalost, iako je značaj obolje-\nnja i njegov zdravstveni i socioekonomski uticaj veoma ve-\nliki, još uvek su prisutne razlike u praksi lečenja ovih pacije-\nnata u okviru različitih specijalizacija. Ove razlike se odnose \nna način postavljanja dijagnoze, vreme za izdavanje uputa \ni obavljanja dodatnih dijagnostičkih procedura (najčešće \nnepotrebnih), do razlika u upotrebi i izvođenju različitih re-\npozicionih manevara u lečenju ovih pacijenata28. Procenjuje \nse da je opterećenje zdravstvenog sistema ovom bolešću \nsamo u SAD oko dve milijarde dolara godišnje i da manje od \n20% pacijenata dobije adekvatno lečenje repozicionim ma-\nnevrom5. Skorašnje istraživanje sprovedeno u našoj zemlji \nje pokazalo da je kod nas stanje još nepovoljnije: prosečno \nvreme čekanja naših pacijenata do postavljanja ispravne di-\njagnoze je skoro 11 meseci i samo jedna trećina do jedna \npetina njih bude zbrinuta u skladu sa smernicama dobre kli-\nničke prakse29. Uprkos tome, kod nas se i dalje veoma malo \ngovori o ovom poremećaju i većina kliničara nije detaljno \nupoznata sa dijagnostičkim kriterijumima i načinima lečenja \nBPPV.\nIako su kliničke smernice za dijagnozu i lečenje BPPV \nobjavljene pre više od 15 godina (dopunjene su 2017. go-\ndine)5, ovaj tip vrtoglavice i dalje ostaje dugo neprepoznat \ni neadekvatno lečen kod većine pacijenata, kako u svetu, \ntako i kod nas. Većina publikovanih smernica je u formi pre-\nporuka, za ili protiv određenih postupaka, i sastavljene su \nda bi olakšale posao kliničaru, tj. da bi standardizovale sve \ndijagnostičke i terapijske procedure u cilju najboljeg mogu-\nćeg ishoda lečenja naših pacijenata i smanjenja cene uku-\npnih medicinskih troškova (tabela 2). \nPrema podacima iz Klinike za otorinolaringologiju i \nmaksilofacijalnu hirurgiju, Univerzitetskog kliničkog centra \nSrbije, poštovanje preporuka za lečenje u Srbiji je veoma va-\nrijabilno i javlja se, u od 0 do 40,5% slučajeva, u zavisnosti \nod tipa preporuke29. Što se tiče izričitih preporuka 1a (po-\nstavljanje dijagnoze p-SCC BPPV) i 4a (lečenja odgovaraju-\nćim repozicionim manevrima), u našem uzorku preporuke \nsu ispoštovane u samo 31%, tj. 21% slučajeva.\nIako postoji preporuka da nisu potrebna dodatna sni-\nmanja, specijalistički pregledi i medikamentozna terapija \nkod pacijenata koji ispunjavaju anamnestičke dijagnostičke \nkriterijume, ipak se u Srbiji preko 80% pacijenata sa BPPV \npodvrgava bar jednom dodatnom snimanju (najčešće CT \nendokranijuma i RTG vratne kičme) ili pregledu (najčešće \nneurološkom). Takođe, skoro tri četvrtine pacijenata dobi-\nja i medikamentoznu terapiju (najčešće betahistin), kako u \nprimarnoj zdravstvenoj zaštiti, tako i u urgentnim centrima. \nU našem uzorku nijednom pacijentu nije ponuđena vesti-\nbularna rehabilitacija, iako se zna da može povoljno uticati \ni ubrzati oporavak29, 30. I na kraju, veoma je važna edukacija \npacijenta o potencijalnim komplikacijama i sklonost bolesti \nka recidivu31, 32.\n82 DOI: 10.5937/Galmed2308080B\nSmernica za: Postupak Jačina dokaza\n1a.

Dopunjene kliničke smernice za postavljanje dijagnoze i lečenje pacijenata sa BPPV od strane Američke akademije za otorinolarin-\ngologiju i hirurgiju glave i vrata (adaptirano)5\nKako unaprediti prepoznavanje \ni lečenje BPPV?\nOstaje još puno pitanja na koja treba dati odgovor, kako \no trenutnoj kliničkoj praksi, tako i o perspektivama za dalje \nunapređenje dijagnostike i lečenja BPPV. \nNe postoje studije o odnosu cene i efikasnosti u leče-\nnju, kao i o tome da li je neophodno raditi snimanje sluha \nsvakom pacijentu sa BPPV. Takođe, nema dovoljno dokaza o \npojedinim aspektima lečenja BPPV (na primer, korist od ve-\nstibularne rehabilitacije u smanjenju stope recidiva), a nije \nurađena ni standardizacija pojedinih repozicionih manevara \nkoji se koriste33. Poslednje smernice su veoma jasne i sadrže sve što je neophodno za uspešno rano postavljanje dijagno-\nze kao i za lečenje pacijenata sa BPPV.\nNajvažniji korak ka poboljšanju lečenja i smanjenju troš-\nkova zdravstvene zaštite je usvajanje preporuka dobre kli-\nničke prakse i standardizacija lečenja. To je najbolje učiniti \nkroz podršku u jedinstvenom zdravstvenom sistemu, kon-\ntinuiranu edukaciju lekara, prvenstveno lekara opšte prak-\nse i gerijatara, pa potom i neurologa i otorinolaringologa u \nprimarnoj i sekundarnoj zdravstvenoj zaštiti, jer su to lekari \nkoji najčešće prvi sreću pacijente sa BPPV. Jasne smernice za \nlekare i strategija na nacionalnom nivou, kako blagovreme-\nno zbrinuti pacijenta sa BPPV ili uputiti dalje kod lekara koji \nmože postaviti dijagnozu i izlečiti pacijenta, su od izuzetnog \nznačaja za poboljšanje ishoda lečenja i uštedu.\nZaključak\nIako predstavlja najčešću formu vrtoglavice koja se viđa u svakodnevnoj kliničkoj praksi, BPPV je i \ndalje nedovoljno prepoznat i lečen, kako kod nas, tako i u svetu. Poznavanje smernica i savremenih \npreporuka za postavljanje dijagnoze i lečenja, stalna edukacija lekara i podrška su od izuzetnog \nznačaja, jer vode standardizaciji lečenja, boljim ishodima i smanjenju troškova zdravstvene zaštite.\nAbstract\nBPPV is characterized by short periodic episodes of vertigo caused by changes in head position and abnormal stimulation \nof the cupula of one of the three semicircular canals in the inner ear, most commonly, the posterior.

Our responsibilities under those standards are fu rther described in the \n“Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of our report.  We have been \nindependent of the Bank during the whole period of our appointment in accordance with the International \nEthics Standards Boar d for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) as \nincorporated into Greek legislation and the ethical requirements in Greece relevant to the audit of the \nfinancial statements and we have fulfilled our ethical requirements in ac cordance with the applicable \nlegislation and the above mentioned Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained \nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  \n \nEmphasis of Matter  \n \nWe draw your attention to note 28 of the financial statements where it is described the negative impact of \nthe geopolitical turmoil in Ukraine and Russia, that begun in February 2022, on the quality of some of the \nBank’s assets.  \n  \nOur report is not qualified in respect to this matter . \n  \nKey Audit Matters  \n \nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our \naudit of the financial statements of the current year.  These matters and the assessed risks of material \nmisstatements  were addressed in the context of  our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in \nforming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  \n \n \n \n\n 3 \n   \n \n \n \n \nKey audit matter  How the matter was addressed in our audit  \nExpected Credit Loss on Loans at amortized cost  \nLoans at amortized cost of the Bank amounted \nto EUR 2,329 million as at 31 December 2021 \n(EUR 2,030 million as at 31 December 2020) \nand loss impairment to EUR 44 million (EUR 56 \nmillion as at 31 December 2020) as presented \non the Statement of Financial Position.  \n \nΤhe Bank measures Expected Credit Losses \n(ECL) for loans at amortized cost both on an \nindividual and a collective basis.  \n \nThe estimation of ECL on loans at amortized \ncost is considered a key audit matter as it is a \ncomplex calculati on that involves the use of a \nnumber of assumptions and parameters such as \nprobability of default (PD), Loss Given Default \n(LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) as well as \nassumptions around the inputs used and \nprobability weight of the multiple economic \nscenarios.   \n \nSignificant Management judgements also \nrelates to the criteria used for the staging \nassessment of loans at amortized cost.  \n \nManagement provided further information about \nprinciples and accounting policies for \ndetermining the allowance for impair ment on \nloans at amortized cost and the management of \ncredit risk in notes 3.6, 5, 12 and 15 to the \nfinancial statements.  \n Based on our risk assessment and following a risk  \nbased approach, we have evaluated the impairment \nmethodologies applied and assumptions made by \nManagement in relation to this key audit matter, \nwhich included, inter alia, the following audit \nprocedures:  \n \n- we obtained an understanding of the \nprocedures and evaluated the design and \nimplementation of relevant internal controls \nwithin the business process.  \n- we assessed the appropriateness of the \nBank’s IFRS 9 impairment methodologies.  \n- with the support of our internal financial risk \nmodeling specialists we assessed the \nreasonableness of Management’s \nassumptions and input data used in the \nmodel, including the analysis of the \nforecasted macroeconomic variables.  We \ntested the mechanical elements of the \ncalculations such as the EAD, the PD and \nstage allocation and reperformed the \ncalculation of the ECL on a sample basis.  \n- we tested the acc uracy and completeness \nof critical data used in the ECL calculation \nby agreeing a sample of ECL calculation \ndata points to source systems or \ndocumentation.  \n- on a sample basis we assessed the \nreasonableness of the estimated expected \ncredit loss for the indiv idually assessed \ncredit impaired exposures.  \n \nWe assessed the adequacy and completeness of \nthe Bank’s disclosures in respect of credit risk, \nstructure and quality of loan portfolio and \nimpairment allowance in accordance with IFRS 9.  \n \nOther Information  \n \nManagement is responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises the information \nincluded in the Annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.   \n \nOur opinion on the financial statements doe s not cover the other information and we will not express any \nform of assurance conclusion thereon.  \n \nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information \nand, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial  \nstatements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, \nbased on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement in this other \ninformation, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.  \n \n \n \n \n\n 4 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements  \n \nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in \naccordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable \nthe preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or \nerror.  \n \nIn preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to \ncontinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the \ngoing concern basis of accou nting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease \noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  \n \nThe Audit Committee of the Bank is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.  \n \nAuditor’s Responsibil ities for the Audit of the Financial Statements   \n \nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit \nconducted in accordance with ISAs , as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation,  will always \ndetect a material misstatement when it  exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.  \n \nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation, we \nexercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  \n \n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstateme nt of the financial statements, whether due to \nfraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk of not \ndetecting a mate rial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, \nas fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override \nof internal control.  \n \n• Obtain an understanding of internal control releva nt to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \neffectiveness of the Bank's internal control.  \n \n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used a nd the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by Management.  \n \n• Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting \nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertaint y exists related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern.  \nIf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s \nreport to the related disc losures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, \nto modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date \nof our auditor’s report.  However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to  cease to \ncontinue as a going concern.  \n \n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the \ndisclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and \nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  \n \n \n \n\n 5 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope \nand timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control \nthat we identify during our audit.  \n \nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant \nethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other \nmatters that may reaso nably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related \nsafeguards.  \n \nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that \nwere of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters.  \n \nAthens, 6 June  2022 \n \nThe Certified Public Accountant  \n \n \n \nAlexandra Kostara  \nReg.

The Bank commenced operations on 1 June 1999.  \n \nThe purpose of the Bank is to accelerate development and promote cooperation among its sharehold er \ncountries. As a regional development institution, the Bank is well placed to mobilize financial resources \nand to improve access to financing for businesses in the whole region as well as for those active only in its \nindividual Member Countries. The Bank  offers project and trade financing facilities, equity participations \nand guarantees. Bank financing of projects and programs is available directly or in cooperation with other \nnational and international development institutions. The Bank may also, where a ppropriate, provide \ntechnical assistance to potential customers.  \n \nAs at financial position date the Bank's shareholders comprised of the following 11 countries: Albania, \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federati on, Turkey and \nUkraine.  \n \n1.2 Headquarters Agreement  \n \nThe status, privileges and immunities of the Bank and persons connected therewith in the Hellenic Republic \nare defined in the Headquarters Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and th e \nBank (‘Headquarters Agreement’) signed on 22 October 1998.  \n \n1.3 Governing Bodies  \n \nEach of the Member States of the Bank is represented on the Board of Governors (BoG), with all powers \nof the Bank vested in the BoG. With the exception of certain reserved powers, the BoG has delegated the \nexercise of its powers to the Board of Directors (BoD), while retaining overall authority.  \n \nBoG and BoD members can be changed at any time upon the discretion of the respective Member State.  \n \n1.3.1  Board of Governors  \n  \n \nCountry  Governor  \nAlbania  \nArmenia  \nAzerbaijan  \nBulgaria  \nGeorgia  \nGreece  \nMoldova  \nRomania  \nRussia  \nTurkey  \nUkraine  Ms. Adela Xhemali  \nMr. Arthur Javadyan  \nMr. Samir Sharifov  \nMs. M onica Dimitrova -Beecher  \nMr. Koba Gvenetadze  \nMr. Adonis -Spyridon Georgiadis  \nMr. Dumitru Budianschi  \nMr. Alin Chitu  \nMr. Timur Maksimov  \nMr. Murat Zaman  \nMr. Yuliia  Svyrydenko  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n1.3.2 Board of Directors  \n \nCountry  Director  \nAlbania  \nArmenia  \nAzerbaijan  \nBulgaria  \nGeorgia  \nGreece  \nMoldova  \nRomania  \nRussia  \nTurkey  \nUkraine  Mr. Arlind Gjokuta  \nMr. Andranik Grigoryan  \nMr. Famil Ismayilov  \nMs. Milena Boykova  \nMr. Ekaterine Guntsadze  \nMr. Ioannis Tsakiris  \nMs. Elena Matveeva  \nMs. Diana Blindu  \nMr. Dmitry Birichevskiy  \nDr. Serhat Koksal  \nMr. Taras Kachka  \n \n \n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  \n \n2.1 Basis of Preparation  \n \nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  \n \nThese financial statements for the year ended 202 1 were submitted by the Management Committee  to the \nBoard of Directors (BoD) for approval on 6 June  2022  and were approved for issuance on that date.  \n \nPursuant to Article 23 of the Establishing Agreement, these financial statements shall be subject to \napproval by  the Board of Governors (BoG) in their Annual Meeting to be held on 23 June 202 2. \n \nBasis of measurement  \n \nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the below assets \nand liabilities which have been measured at fair value:  \n• Debt investment securities at fair value through other comprehensive income;  \n• Loans at fair value through profit or loss;  \n• Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss;  \n• Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income;  \n• Derivative financial instruments ; and \n• Plan assets.  \n \nFunctional and presentation currency  \n \nThe Bank’s functional currency is the Euro ( EUR) as defined by the European Central Bank (ECB). \nThe Euro is most representative of the Bank’s operations and environment as a significant \npercentage of the Bank’s lending operations are in Euro, and the administrative expenses and \ncapital expenditures are primarily denominated and settled in this currency. The Bank’s \npresentation currency is the EUR  and values are rounded to the nearest thousand unless \notherwise stated . \n \nUse of Estimates and J udgments  \n \nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make \njudgments and  use of estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting \npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the di sclosure of contingent assets and \nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and \nexpenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may differ from those reported.  Estimates and \nunderlying assumptions are rev iewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized \nprospectively.  \n \n 13 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nThe areas where the Bank has applied judgement and used estimates and assumptions are : \nestimation of expected credit losses of loans, fair valuation of financial instruments not quoted in \nactive markets, including OTC derivatives and certain debt securities, impairment of investment \nsecurities, estimation of retirement benefits obligation, and contingencies from litigation.  \n \nThe areas involvin g a higher degree of judgment or areas where assumptions and estimates are \nsignificant to the financial statements are disclosed in the Note  4. \n \n2.2 Going Concern  \n \nThe Bank’s Board of Governors considered the Bank’s ongoing financial sustainability when approving the \nBank’s “Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) 2021 -2030” in June 2021, which reflects the Bank’s \nprospects and the ways in which its shareholders would like it to evolve.  \n \nFurther and in support of the new LTSF, the Board o f Governors has approved an increase to the \nsubscribed capital of the Bank, to take place over the period 2023 -2030.  \n  \nThe financial statements for 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Bank’s capital and \nliquidity position were confirmed b y the Board of Directors o n 6 June 2022 , the date on which the financial \nstatements were approved.  \n \nIn the context of formulation and approval of the next Medium -term Strategy and Business Plan 2023 -\n2026, the Board of Governors will provide in the second half of the year the necessary guidance and in this \ncontext will recommend adjustments to the LTSF 2021 -2030 to the extent to which it will be deemed \nappropriate.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  \n \nA summary of the Bank’s accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are \npresented in this section. These policies are the same as those applied for the comparative period \npresented taking in to account the amendments to standards which were issued by the International \nAccounting Standards Board (IASB), which are further analyzed below:  \n \n3.1 Adoption of New and Amended Standards (IFRS)  \n \nNew standards and amendments to standards which were issue d by the International Accounting \nStandards Board (IASB), applied on 1 January 202 1: \n \n• IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements  \n \nIAS 1 sets out the overall requirements for financial statements, including how they should be \nstructured, the minimum requirements for their content and overriding concepts such as going \nconcern, the accrual basis of accounting and the current/non -current distinction. The standard \nrequires a complete set of financial statements to comprise a statement of financial positio n, a \nstatement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, a statement of changes in equity \nand a statement of cash flows.  Effective 1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The \namendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or aft er 1 January 2023. Earlier \napplication is permitted.  The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank’s \nfinancial statements.  \n \n• IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors  \n \nIAS 8 is applied in selecting and applying accounting policies, accounting for changes in estimates \nand reflecting corrections of prior period errors. The standard requires compliance with any \nspecific IFRS applying to a transaction, event or condition, and provides guidance on developing \naccounting policies for other items that result in relevant and reliable information. Changes in \naccounting policies and corrections of errors are generally retrospectively accounted for, whereas \nchanges in accounting estimates are generally accounted for on a prospective basis.  Effective \n1January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual periods \nbeginning on or after 1 January 2023. Earlier application is permitted.  The adoption is not \nexpected to have an y material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.  \n \n• IAS 12: Income Taxes  \n \nIAS 12 implements a so -called 'comprehensive balance sheet method' of accounting for income \ntaxes which recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and events and the \nfuture tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of an entity's \nassets and liabilities. Differences between the carrying amount and tax base of assets and \nliabilities, and carried forward tax losses and cre dits, are recognized, with limited exceptions, as \ndeferred tax liabilities or deferred tax assets, with the latter also being subject to a 'probable \nprofits' test.  First effective as Canadian GAAP under Part I for interim and annual financial \nstatements re lating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011. The amendments are \neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earlier application is permitted. \nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or a fter 1 January 2023. \nEarly adoption is permitted.  The adoption will not have any impact on the Bank’s financial \nstatements.  \n \n• IAS 1 6: Property, Plant and Equipment  \n \nIAS 16 outlines the accounting treatment for most types of property, plant and equipment. \nProperty, plant and equipment is initially measured at its cost, subsequently measured either \nusing a cost or revaluation model, and depreciated so that its depreciable amount is allocated on \na systematic basis over its useful life . \n \n \n 15 \n  Notes to t he Financial Statements  \n \nEffective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after \n1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual periods \nbeginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitted.  The adoption is not expected \nto have any material impact on the Bank’s financial statement s. \n \n• IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  \n \nIAS 37 outlines the accounting for provisions (liabilities of uncertain timing or amount), together \nwith contingent assets (possible assets) and contingent liabilities (possible obligations and \npresent obligations that are not probable or not reliably measurable).  Effective for interim and \nannual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2011, earlier \napplication is permitted. The amendments are  effective for annual periods beginning on or after \n1 January 2022. Early application is permitted.  The adoption is not expected to have any material \nimpact on the Bank’s financial statements.  \n \n• IAS 41: Agriculture  \n \nIAS 41 sets out the accounting for agricultural activity – the transformation of biological assets \n(living plants and animals) into agricultural produce (harvested product of the entity's biological \nassets). The standard generally requires biological assets to be measured at fair value less  costs \nto sell.  Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on \nor after 1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual \nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Ear ly application is permitted. The adoption will not \nhave any impact on the Bank’s financial statements.  \n \n• IFRS 1: First -time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards  \n \nIFRS 1 sets out the procedures that an entity must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time as \nthe basis for preparing its general  purpose financial statements. The IFRS grants limited \nexemptions from the general requirement to comply with each IFRS effective at the end of its first \nIFRS reporting period.  Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years \nbeginning on or after 1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are \neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitte d. \nThe adoption will not have any impact on the Bank’s financial statements.  \n \n• IFRS 3: Business Combinations  \n \nIFRS 3 outlines the accounting when an acquirer obtains control of a business (e.g. an acquisition \nor merger). Such business combinations are accou nted for using the 'acquisition method', which \ngenerally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their fair values at \nthe acquisition date.  Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years \nbeginning on or after 1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are \neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application i s permitted if \nan entity also applies all other updated references (published together with the updated \nConceptual Framework) at the same time or earlier.  The adoption is not expected to have any \nmaterial impact on the Bank’s financial statements.  \n \n• IFRS 17 : Insurance Contracts  \n \nIFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure \nof insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. The objective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that \nan entity provides relevant information that faithfully rep resents those contracts. This information \ngives a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that insurance contracts have \non the entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The IASB tentatively \ndecided to defer the  effective date of IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts to annual periods beginning \non or after 1 January 2022  [The IASB has also published 'Extension of the Temporary Exemption \nfrom Applying IFRS 9 (Amendments to IFRS 4)' to defer the fixed expiry date of the amendment \nalso to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023] . The adoption is not expected to ha ve \nany material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.  \n 16 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n3.2 Foreign Currencies Translation  \n \nForeign currency transactions are initially recorded in EUR by applying to the foreign currency amount the \nexchange rate betwe en the EUR and the foreign currency at the rate prevailing at the date of transaction.  \n \nWhen preparing the financial statements exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of \nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at y ear end are recognized in the income \nstatement.  \n \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euro at the exchange \nrate at the reporting date. The foreign exchange gain or loss on monetary items is the difference be tween \nthe amortized cost in Euro at the beginning of the year, adjusted for the effective interest, impairment and \nprepayments during the year, and the amortized cost in the foreign currency translated at the exchange \nrate at the end of the year.  \n \nNon-mone tary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the \nexchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences are generally recognized in \nincome statement except for foreign exchange differences o n non -monetary items which are at FVTOCI \nas equity investments which are recognized in other comprehensive income.  \n \nThe Bank uses the official exchange rates published for the EUR by the European Central Bank (ECB). \nThe exchange rates used by the Bank at t he financial position date were as follows.  \n \n \n   31 December  \n2021 31 December  \n2020 \n \n \n \n1 EUR  = \n= \n= \n= \n= \n= \n= United States dollar  \nPound sterling  \nRussian ruble  \nAzerbaijan manat  \nGeorgian lari  \nArmenian dram  \nRomanian leu  1.13260 \n0.84028 \n85.3004 0 \n1.9265 0 \n3.5040 0 \n542.61000 \n4.94900  1.22710  \n0.89903  \n91.46710  \n2.08900  \n4.02330  \n641.11000  \n4.86830  \n \n \n3.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents  \n \nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, \nplacements with other financial institutions and debt securities with maturities of three months or less  from \nthe financial position date . These are highly liquid assets that are readily convertible to a known amount of \ncash and are subject to insignificant risk of change in va lue due to the movements in market rates.  \n \n3.4 Recognition and Initial Measurement, and Derecognition of Financial Instruments  \n \nThe Bank recognizes a financial asset or financial liability in its statement of financial position when it \nbecomes a party to the contractual rights or obligations.  \n \n3.4.1  Date of recognition  \n \nFinancial assets and liabilities, with the exception of loans and advances to customers and \nbalances due to customers, are initially recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date on which the \nBank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way \ntrades, i.e., purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame \ngenerally established by regulation or conven tion in the market place. Loans and advances to \ncustomers are recognized when funds are transferred to the customer’s account.  \n \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at \nFair Value Through Prof it and Loss ( FVTPL ), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its \nacquisition or issue. The fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is generally its \ntransaction  price.  \n 17 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n3.4.2  Date of derecogn ition  \n \nThe Bank derecognizes a financial asset or a portion of a financial asset when (i) the contractual \nrights to the cash flow from the financial asset expire, (ii) loses control of the contractual rights that \ncomprise the financial asset or a portion o f the financial asset or (i) the Bank retains the right to \nreceive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed the obligation to pay it in full without material \ndelay to a third party under a ‘pass through’ arrangement. The Bank derecognizes a financial \nliability when a liability is extinguished, that is when the obligation specified in the contract is \ndischarged, cancelled or expires. The evaluation of the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership \nprecedes the evaluation of the transfer of control for dere cognition transactions.  \n \nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or \nthe carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized) and the sum of (i) the \nconsideration received (including any  new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) \nany cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in income statement . \n \nAny cumulative gain or loss recognized in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated  \nas at F air Value through Other Comprehensive Income  (FVTOCI ) is not recognized in income \nstatement on derecognition of such securities.  \n \n3.5 Financial Assets  \n \nThe classification of financial assets defines how existing information is reflected in the financial \nstatements. In particular, the valuation method and the impairment calculation are defined by this \nclassification, which are based on criteria established  by the Bank.  \n \n3.5.1 Classification  and subsequent measurement  \n \nThe Bank classifies a financial asset in its financial statements  in one of the below three \nmeasurement categories : \n \n1. Financial assets measured at amortized cost (AC) : this category includes  each asset or \ngroup of assets for which the Bank's business model constitutes its holding for the purpose \nof collecting contractual cash flows. Financial assets are classified at AC only if both of the \nfollowing criteria are met:  \n- The objective of the Bank’s business model is to hold financial asset s in order to \ncollect the contractual cash flows; and  \n- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash \nflows that are solely payments of principal and inte rest on the principal \noutstanding:  \n \nThe Bank  includes in this category financial assets which are non -derivative with fixed or \ndeterminable payments and with fixed maturities  meeting the above criteria . They are  \ninitially  recognized  at fair value plus any transaction costs and including any premium or \ndiscount that may arise on the date of acquisition. Third party expenses, such as legal \nfees, incurred in securing a loan are treated as part of the cost of the transaction. They are \nsubsequently measured at A C using the effective interest method, less any allowance for \nexpected credit losses . All such financial assets are recognized on settlement date.  \n \nThese financial assets include cash and due from banks , loans  and receivables accrued  \nthat meet the above cr iteria.  \n \n2. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) , \nwith gains or losses reclassified on profit or loss on derecognition. The Bank classifies \ndebt instruments (including euro commercial paper (ECP)) at FVTOCI when both of the \nfollowing conditions are met:  \n- The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which  is achieved \nby both collecting the contractual cash flows and selling financial asset s; and  \n- The contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely \npayments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding . \n 18 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nFVTOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with g ains and losses \nthat arise from fluctuat ions in fair value  recognized in OCI . Their fair value is determined \nby reference to quoted market bid prices. On derecognition cumulative gain or loss \npreviously recognized in OCI are reclassified from OCI to income statement . Foreign \nexchange gains or lo sses and  interest income calculated  using the effective interest rate \nmethod are recognized in income  statement . \n \nAll such financial assets are recognized on trade date.  \n \nThe Expected Credit Losses ( ECL) for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce \nthe carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which \nremains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the \nassets were measured at amortized cost is recognized in OCI as an accumulated \nimpairment amount, with a corresponding charge to the profit or loss. The accumulated \nloss recognized in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss upon derecognition of the assets.  \n \n3. Financial assets (eq uity instruments) measured at FVTOCI, with no reclassification of \ngains or losses to profit or loss on derecognition . On initial recognition the Bank can make \nthe irrevocable election, on an instrument -by-instrument basis, to designate investments \nin an equity instrument which are not held for trading nor contingent consideration \nrecognized by an acquirer in a business combination, as a financial asset measured at \nFVTOCI. Those not elected, which are  primarily  listed, are measured at Fair Value \nThrough Profit or Loss ( FVTPL ). Dividends received are recorded in the income statement.  \n \nAfter initial recognition at cost, these financial assets are subsequently measured at fair \nvalue with all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value  (realized and unrealized), \nincluding foreign exchange gains and losses, recognized in other comprehensive income , \nand are not reclassified to income statement. For those financial instruments there is no \nimpairment assessment. T he fair value for those not  purchased from an active market is \ndetermined using accepted valuation techniques  which use unobservable inputs . These \nvaluation techniques used are net asset value , when this is deemed to approximate fair \nvalue,  and earnings -based valuations using compar able information and discounting cash \nflows.  The Bank’s equity investments are included in this category. All such financial \nassets are recognized on settlement date.  \n \n4. Financial assets measured at FVTPL : this category includes  financial assets that do not \nmeet the criteria to be classified in any of the above categories  as well as financial assets  \nthat the Bank holds for trading.  Their classification depends primarily on the following two \nimportant factors (i) the Bank’s busine ss model for these assets and (ii) the characteristics \nof the contractual cash flows of the asset.  \n \nThese financial assets are initially measured at their fair value and subsequently carried \nat fair value on the statement of financial position with all cha nges in fair value gains and \nlosses and foreign exchange gains and losses, recognized in the income statement in the \nperiod in which they occur. Transaction costs on these financial assets are expensed in \nthe income statement. This category includes deriva tive financial instruments, equity \nsecurities as well as any loans for which either of the criteria for recognition at AC is not \nmet. It can also include a debt instrument or an equity instrument that is not within the \ncategory nor measured at FVTOCI.  All such financial assets are recognized on trade date.  \n \nIn addition, a debt instrument that could meet AC criteria can be designated  at initial \nrecognition  as at FVTPL.  This classification option, which is irrevocable , is used when the  \ndesignation eliminates  a measurement or recognition inconsistency, referred to as an \n‘accounting mismatch’, which would arise from measuring financial assets  and liabilities \non a different basis in relation to another financial asset or liability.  \n \nAs at the reporting date the Bank has not designated, at initial recognition, any financial \nasset as at FVTPL.  \n \n 19 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n3.5.2 Measurement  \n \nThe Bank measures financial assets at fair value on initial recognition, as detailed above. In the \nevent the Bank considers that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price, \nthat difference is recognized as a gain or loss on in itial recognition but only if the fair value is based \non a requested active market price for identical assets or is based on a valuation technique using \ndata solely from identified markets. In all other cases, the difference between the transaction price \nand the fair value is deferred and is only recognized in the income statement when the inputs \nbecome observable, or when the instrument is derecognized.  \n \nFinancial assets that are subsequently measured at either AC or debt instruments at FVTOCI, are \nsubject  to provisions for impairment.  \n \nBased on the Bank's credit policy, the Bank does not originate credit -impaired financial assets, nor \ndoes the Bank purchase credit -impaired assets, exception being those loans would be acquired at \na deep discount.  \n \nFinancial  assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period \nafter the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets.  \n \n3.5.3 Business model assessment  \n \nThe factor of the business model refers, amongst others, t o the manner in which the Bank manages \nits financial assets by classifying them in portfolios that are part of its business model.  The adopted \nbusiness model determines the source of revenue, as it arises from individual portfolios either \nthrough the colle ction of contractual cash flows or from the sale of financial assets or the \ncombination of the above.  \n \nThe assessment of the business model reflects the Bank's strategy under normal business \nconditions. The assessment is not affected by actions required in ‘emergency situations’ (e.g. : \nliquidity needs, non -inherent capital requirements for credit risk, etc.). Also, Management decisions \ntaken to comply with new regulatory guidelines are not included in the assessment.  \n \nIn general, the Bank has inc luded the majority of its loan portfolios in the hold -to-collect business \nmodel. The assessment of a business model is made within the definition of operational objectives \nas defined by the Bank's Management, as well as in the operational management of its  assets. \nThe assessment is effected at portfolio level rather than at individual asset levels.  \n \nThe Business Model applied to loan portfolio, treasury portfolio and equity investment portfolio is \nreassessed at each reporting period. The reassessment of the Business Model has been \nestablished in order to determine if evidence initially used has changed.  The assessment process \napplied by the Bank through its business model, based on strategic objectives, classifies its assets \nin the followi ng three categories in accordance with IFRS 9:  \n \ni) Hold to collect  \n \nEach asset or group of assets for which the Bank's business model recommends that it be held for \nthe purpose of collecting contractual cash flows is classified as ‘Hold to collect’.  \n \nii) Hold to collect and sell  \n \nEach asset or group of assets for which the Bank's business model recommends that it be held for \nthe purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and selling them when the strategic planning of \ntheir acquisition has been achieved is class ified as ‘Hold to collect and sell’.  \n \niii) Trading portfolio  \n \nThe financial assets held for trading are classified as ‘Trading portfolio’.  The Bank had no financial \nassets in trading portfolio.  \n 20 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n3.5.4 Loans  \n \nLoans originated by the Bank, is where money is provided directly to the borrower. Loans are \ninitially recorded at fair value, which is usually the net amount disbursed at inception including \ndirectly attributable origination costs and certain types of fees or c ommission (e.g. syndication \ncommission, front -end, commitment fees and handling charges) that are regarded as an \nadjustment to the effective interest rate of the loan, and are subsequently measured at amorti zed \ncost using the effective interest rate method . \n \nThe Bank classifies in loan category bonds which are purchased with a view of a development \nimpact and such purchases are performed based on the Bank’s loan financing criteria and follow \nthe thorough appraisal and approval process of the Bank. Such bond s at 31 December 202 1 were \na gross amount of EUR 294,330 thousand  (2020: EUR 267,588 thousand). Management has \nconcluded that presentation within loans present fairly the Bank’s financial position.  \n \nLoans that are designated as at FVTPL are recognized at a value arrived at by using a combination \nof discounted cash flow models. These model s incorporate market data pertaining to interest rates, \na borrower’s credit rating, and underlying assets. Where unobservable inputs have been used, a \nsensitivity analysis has been included under ‘fair value hierarchy’ described within the ‘Risk \nManagement ’ section of this report.  \n \n3.6 Impairment  \n \n3.6.1 Financial assets  \n \nThe Bank records an allowance for expected credit loss for all loans and loans receivables, and \nother debt instruments held at amortized cost, together with off balance sheet items (loan \ncommitments and financial guarantee contracts). In this section, all referred to as ‘financial \ninstruments’. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9.  \n \ni) Calculation of expected credit loss  \n \nECLs are a probability -weighted avera ge estimate of credit losses that reflects the time value of \nmoney. Upon initial recognition of the financial instruments in scope of the impairment policy, the \nBank records a loss allowance equal to 12 -month ECL, being the ECL that result from default \nevents that are possible within the next twelve months. Subsequently, for those financial \ninstruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial \nrecognition, a loss allowance equal to lifetime ECL is recognized, arising f rom default events that \nare possible over the expected life of the instrument. The expected credit losses are weighted on  \nthe basis of three macroeconomic scenarios (adverse, basic and favorable).  \n \nFor the purposes of calculating expected credit losses, th e financial instruments are classified in \nthree stages as follows:  \n \n• Stage 1: Stage 1 includes performing exposures that do not have significant increase in \ncredit risk since initial recognition. Stage 1 also includes exposures for which credit risk \nhas be en improved and the exposure has been reclassified from Stages 2 or 3. In this \nstage expected credit losses are recognized based on the probability of default within the \nnext 12 months.  \n  \n• Stage 2: Stage 2 includes performing exposures for which there has b een a significant \nincrease in credit risk since initial recognition. Stage 2 also includes exposures for which \nthe credit risk has improved, and the exposure has been reclassified from stage 3. In this \nstage, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized.  \n \n• Stage 3: Stage 3 includes non -performing / credit -impaired exposures. In this stage lifetime \nexpected credit losses are recognized.  \n \n \n 21 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nThe Bank calculates impairment losses on a  portfolio basis , except for financial assets that are \ncredit -impaired in which case they are calculated on an individual basis . The Bank applies three \nmain components to measure expected credit losses which are a LGD, PD and EAD , and assigns \ngeneral market scenarios for  potential cre dit risk deterioration. There can be transfers of exposures \nfrom one stage to another, depending on whether there is a change in the credit risk of that \nexposure. Probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon.  \n \nThe Bank uses information obtained from the Global Emerging Markets (GEMs) database in order \nto assign LGD to its loan asset classes. GEMs is an I nternational Financial Institution (IFI) wide \ninitiative designed to pool default and recovery rates experie nced by IFIs in emerging markets. \nTreasury asset classes derive their PDs from the assigning rating agency. LGD is an estimate of \nthe loss arising on default. The Bank uses information obtained from the GEMs database to assign \nLGDs to its lending asset cla sses, and treasury asset classes derive their LGDs from the assigning \nrating agency.  \n \nii) Basic parameters used for the calculation of expected credit loss  \n \nThe calculation of expected credit losses is based on the following parameters:  \n \n• Probability of Default (PD) represents the probability that a debtor will default on his debt \nobligations either over the next twelve months or over the remaining maturity of  his debt. \nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank uses non -discriminatory point -in-time PDs that adjust \nto macroeconomic assumptions using the Expected Credit Loss.  \n \n• Exposure at Default (EAD) is defined as the estimate of the exposure at a future default \ndate, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, \nincluding repayments of principal and interest, and undrawn commitments based on the \nBank’s own experience.  \n \n• Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the extent of the loss that th e Bank expects for \nexposures that are in default and is defined as the difference between the contractual cash \nflows and those that the Bank expects to collect, including collateral amounts. LGD, which \nis usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD, varie s according to the category of the \ncounterparty, the category and priority of the claim, the existence of collateral and other \ncredit enhancements.  \n \nThe Bank assigns credit rating to each loan at inception based on the internal scorecard \nmethodologies for Financial Institutions, Corporates or Project Finance and all loans are subject to \nannual credit review if rated to a category up to BB+, while all loans below that rating are subject \nto semi -annual credit review. The credit rating is primary input to the PD which is calculated based \non statistical model and incorporates macroeconomic projections.  \n \nThe LGD estimates are according to values and determined estimates mainly by geography and \nby type of counterparty, with three main exposure classes: sovereign, public and private sectors . \nIn case of sovereign default of member countries, the Bank believes that its payment would remain \nuninterrupted, benefitting from its preferred creditor status resulting in no credit risk of impairment \nloss from sovereign exposu res or loans guaranteed by sovereign.  \n \nThe Bank calculates expected credit losses based on the weighted probability of three scenarios. \nMore specifically the Bank uses a statistical model to produce forecasts of the possible evolution \nof macroeconomic variables (GDP and unemployment rate) that affect the level of expected credit \nlosses of loans under a baseline and under alternative macroeconomic scenarios (adverse and \nfavorable) and also assigns the cumulative probabilities associated wit h these scenarios. The \nbaseline scenario is the most likely scenario and is in line with the Bank's information for strategic \nplanning and budgeting purposes.  \n \n \n \n \n 22 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \niii) Significant increase in credit risk  \n \nAt each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has \nincreased significantly since initial recognition. When making the assessment, the Bank compares \nthe risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the r eporting date with the risk of a \ndefault  occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of initial recognition and considers \nreasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort, that is \nindicative of significant inc reases in credit risk since initial recognition.  \n \nIn order to determine whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since \norigination, and hence transition to Stage 2, a combination of quantitative and qualitative risk \nmetrics are used . All loans with at least a 3 -notch downgrade in PD on the Bank’s internal ratings \nscale since origination, all loans for which the contractual payments are overdue by between 31 \nand 90 days inclusive, as well as all loans placed on the ‘watch list’ are tr ansitioned to Stage 2 . \n \nFor financial guarantee contracts, the date the Bank becomes a party to the irrevocable \ncommitment is considered to be the date of initial recognition for the purpose of assessing the \nfinancial instrument for impairment. In assessin g whether there has been a significant increase in \ncredit risk since initial recognition of a financial guarantee contract, the Bank considers the risk that \nthe specified debtor will default on the contract  in line with the above determination for loans.  \n \nGenerally, there will be a significant increase in credit risk before a financial asset becomes credit -\nimpaired or an actual default occurs. The assessment of significant increase in credit risk is key in \ntransferring an exposure from Stage 1 to Stage 2 an d the respective change in the ECL \nmeasurement from 12 -month to lifetime ECL.  \n \niv) Credit -impaired  \n \nA financial asset is credit -impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the \nestimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset \nis credit - impaired includes observable data about the following events:  \n- Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower;  \n- A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;  \n- The lender(s) of t he borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the \nborrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession(s) that the \nlender(s) would not otherwise consider;  \n- It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial \nreorganization;  \n- The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial \ndifficulties; or  \n- The purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred \ncredit losses.  \n \nIt may not be possible to identify a single discrete event – instead, the combined effect of several \nevents may have caused financial assets to become credit -impaired.  \n \nv) Definition of default  \n \nThe definition of default used for determining the risk of a default occurring shall be applied \nconsistently to all financial instruments unless information becomes available that demonstrates \nthat another default definition is more appropriate for a particular financial instrument. The Bank's \ndefinition of defaul t is based on the regulatory definition under Article 178 of the ‘Regulation (EU) \nNo 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union of 26 June \n2013 on prudential requirements for credit banks and investment firms and amending Regulation \n(EU) 648/2012’ (CRR). A default is considered to have occurred when either of the following \nconditions had taken place.  \n \n \n \n \n 23 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \na. Qualitative  \n \nUnlikeliness to Pay (UTP) criterion: the Bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay \nits credit obligations to the Bank without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing \nsecurity. Below there are some elements that are taken as indications of unlikeliness to \npay (in line with CRR (Article 178)).  \n  \n- The Ban k puts the credit obligation on non -accrued status.  \n- The Bank recognizes a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant \nperceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the \nexposure.  \n- The Bank has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an \nobligor's credit obligation to the Bank, the parent undertaking or any of its \nsubsidiaries.  \n- The obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection \nwhere this would avoid or del ay repayment of a credit obligation to the Bank, the \nparent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries.  \n \nb. Quantitative  \n \nPast due criterion: the exposure is past due more than 90 days on any credit obligation to \nthe Bank.  \n \nImpairment losses for guarantees are  recognized while a guarantee is in effect and the \namounts are determined based on the level of utilization of the guarantee. The \nmethodology is consistent to that of loan commitments, and such losses are included in \n‘Other liabilities’.  \n \nInterest income i s calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 1 and 2. \nAs the primary definition for credit -impaired financial assets moving to Stage 3, the Bank applies \nthe definition of default, and interest income is calculated on the net carr ying amount for these \nfinancial assets only.  \n \nIf the amount of impairment subsequently decreases due to an event occurring after a write -down, \nthe release (i.e. reverse) of the impairment is credited to the provision for impairment asset losses. \nUnwinding of the discount is treated as income and remaining provision is then reassessed.  \n \n3.6.2 Non-financial assets  \n \nAt each financial position date, the Bank reviews the carrying value of the non -financial assets and \nassesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indications exist, an analysis is \nperformed to assess whether the book value of the specifi c assets can be recovered. The \nrecoverable amount is the higher amount between the fair value less costs of disposal  and of \nthe value in use (as calculated from the net cash flows). If the carrying value of an intangible asset \nexceeds its recoverable value , then an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement.  \n \n3.6.3 Renegotiated financial assets  \n \nWhen necessary, the Bank seeks to restructure a financial asset that may involve extending the \npayment arrangements and the agreement of new loan terms and conditions. These are generally \nrenegotiated in response to an adverse change in the financial condition of the borrower.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 24 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nModifications occur when the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are rene gotiated or \notherwise modified. Some modifications result in derecognition of the existing asset and \nrecognition of a new asset with the difference recogni zed as a derecognition gain or loss, to the \nextent that an impairment loss has not already been recor ded, while other modifications do not \nresult in derecognition. Modifications that result in derecognition are considered to be substantial \nmodifications. A significant or substantial change is defined when the customer enters into a new \nloan contract (i.e.  completely new product and new pricing) that has a different interest rate type, \nloan amount, term period (temporary term extension is excluded), and/or customer (e.g. from \nsingle customer to joint or change in one of the joint customer names).  \n \nA distressed restructuring is an indication of unlikeliness to pay where this is likely to result in a \ndiminished financial obligation caused by the material  (change in the net present value of the asset \nby more than 10%)  forgiveness, or postponement of eith er principal, interest or, where relevant \nfees. Distressed restructuring occurs when forbearance measures have been extended towards a \ndebtor. Therefore, those forborne exposures where the forbearance measures are likely to result \nin a diminished financial  obligation are classified as defaulted.  \n \nRestructured operations will be considered cured and normalized after two successful repayments \n(average of 6 months per repayment) and could therefore be subject to a Stage movement.  \n \nFor loans that are modified the Bank recalculates the gross book value based on the revised cash \nflows on the financial asset and recognizes the profit or loss from the modification in income \nstatement. The new gross book value is recalculated by discounting the modified cas h flows at the \noriginal effective interest rate.  \n \n3.6.4 Write -offs \n \nAccording to the IFRS 9 (B5.4.9), the gross carrying amount of a financial asset may be directly \nreduced when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the financial asset in its en tirety or \na portion of it. As such, the Bank may record a write -off of Stage 3 loans. The Bank may also, on \nan ad -hoc basis, examine the need for any further write -offs of Stage 2 loans if there is relevant \nevidence.  \n \n3.6.5 Write -backs  \n \nRecoveries (write -backs) of an asset, or part thereof, are credited to the income statement if \npreviously written off.  \n \n3.7 Financial Liabilities  \n \nThe Bank recognizes a financial liability in its financial statements at the time of the arising from the item \n(that is, the day the transaction took place). Financial liabilities primarily include (a) borrowings and (b) \nother liabilities.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 25 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n3.7.1 Borrowings  \n \nBorrowing transactions which are amounts due to financial institutions and debts evidence by \ncertificates, are recognized in the statement of financial position at the time the funds are \ntransferred to the Bank. They are measured initially at the fair value of the funds transferred, less \nany transaction costs.  They are subsequently measured at amortized cost unless they qualify for \nhedge accounting in which case the amortized cost is adjus ted for the fair value  movements \nattributable to the to the risks being hedged. I nterest expense is accrued  in the income statement  \nwithin “Interest expense”  using the effective interest rate method.  \n \n3.7.2 Other liabilities  \n \nOther liabilities that are not  derivatives or designated at FVTPL, are recorded at amortized cost . \nThe amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.  \n \n3.8 Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities  \n \nOffsetting of financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements is permitted if, and only if, there is a \ncurrently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a \nnet basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simulta neously.  \n \n3.9 Derivatives  \n \nIn the ordinary course of business, the Bank enters into various types of transactions that involve derivative \nfinancial instruments. A derivative financial instrument is a financial contract between two parties, where \nfuture payments are dependent upon movements in price in one or more underlying financial instruments, \nreference rates or indices.  \n \nThe Bank primarily makes use of derivatives for the below strategic purposes:  \n \n- Many of the Bank’s issued securities, excludi ng commercial paper, are individually paired with a \nswap to convert the issuance proceeds into the currency and interest rate structure sought by the \nBank.  \n- To manage the net interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks arising from all financial assets \nand liabilities.  \n- Through currency swaps, to manage funding requirements for the Bank’s loan portfolio.  \n \nDerivatives can include interest rate and cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, \ninterest rate future contracts, and options on intere st rates and foreign currencies. Such financial \ninstruments are initially recognized in the statement of financial position (SOFP) at fair value and are \nsubsequently measured at their fair value. They are carried in the SOFP as assets when their fair value  is \npositive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.  \n \nChanges in fair value of derivative financial instruments are included in the income statement. Fair values \nare obtained from quoted market  prices to the extent publicly available, discoun ted cash flows and options \npricing models as appropriate.  \n \nThe Bank enters into derivatives, to protect the Bank from financial risks such as currency risk, market \nprice risk and interest rate risk. Such hedges are entered into to lessen or eliminate econo mic exposure. \nThe Bank’s policies on risk management are to not take significant interest rate or foreign exchange risks, \nand to aim where possible to match assets, liabilities and derivatives.  \n \nThe majority of the Bank’s lending activities is at floating rates linked to USD Libor or Euribor. When lending \nat a fixed rate the Bank will often use interest rate swaps to produce floating rate interest payments.  \n \nThe Bank’s borrowings, particularly bonds issuances, tend to be at a fixed rate and sometimes in currency \ndenominations other than EUR or USD. The Bank in order mitigate the aforementioned  underlying risks \nuses either interest rate or cross currency interest rate swaps to produce floating rate liabilities in USD or \nEUR.  \n \n 26 \n  Notes to the Fina ncial Statements  \n \nAll the Bank’s interest rate or cross currency swaps are explicitly tied to a balance sheet asset or liability. \nTypically, the fixed rate on the swap and the matching asset or liability have the same characteristics (term, \npayment dates etc.).  \n \nForeign exchange forwards (paired purchases and sales of currencies on different dates) of maturities \ntypically less than three months are not tied to specific assets or liabilities. These are undertaken to manage \nsurpluses and shortfalls in EUR and USD and are not undertaken for speculative purposes.  All derivatives \nare documented under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreement \nwith Credit Swap Annexes (CSAs) and marked to market and cash collateralized d aily. The Department of \nTreasury, under the guidance of ALCO and the supervision of the ALM unit, is responsible for the primary \nusage and managing interest rate and currency risks in the Bank’s statement of financial position.  \n \nThe notional amounts and fa ir values of the derivative instruments are disclosed in Note 14. The fair value \nhierarchy level of derivatives is disclosed in Note 5.  \n \n 3.9.1 Derivatives and hedge accounting  \n \nThe Bank designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency rate \nand interest rate risk in fair value or cash flow hedges. The bank does not apply fair value hedge \naccounting of portfolio of hedges of interest rate risk. In addition, the bank does not use the \nexception to continue using IAS 39 hedg e accounting rules, that is the Bank applies IFRS 9 in full.  \n \nIn accordance with its wider risk management, as set out in Note 5, when a hedging relationship \nmeets the specified hedge accounting criteria, it is the Bank’s strategy to apply either fair valu e or \ncash flow hedges based on the exposure being hedged. Transactions that are entered into in \naccordance with the Bank’s hedging objectives, but do not qualify for hedge accounting, are \nreferred to in these financial statements as economic hedge relation ships.  \n \nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, the Bank formally documents how the hedging \nrelationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, by recording the economic relationship between \nthe hedged item and the hedging instrument, the nature of the r isk, the risk management objective \nand strategy for undertaking the hedge as well as the method that will be used to assess the \neffectiveness of the hedging relationship. Furthermore, both at the inception and on an ongoing \nbasis (at least on each reportin g date or upon significant change, whichever comes first), the Bank \ndocuments whether an economic relationship exists between the hedging instrument and the \nhedged item.  \n \n In order the Bank to apply hedge accounting, the following requirements must be met:  \n \n- There must be an expectation that the fair value or the cash flows of the hedging \ninstrument and the value or the cash flows of the hedged item, will “systematically” change \nin response to movements in the same underlying(s) that are economically related, \nproviding a degree of offset between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The \nassessment relates to expectations about hedge effectiveness and is only forward -looking.  \n \n- The effect of credit risk should not dominate the value ch anges that result from that \neconomic relationship.  \n \n- The weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which define the hedge \nratio of the hedging relationship, are the same as that resulting from the quantity of the \nhedged item that the Bank ac tually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that \nthe Bank actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.  \n \n- If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to \nthe hedge ratio but the risk management ob jective for that designated hedging relationship \nremains the same, the Bank adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship by \nrebalancing the hedge, so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.  \n \n \n 27 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nFor the assessment of hedge effectiveness requirements and when measuring the hedge \neffectiveness / ineffectiveness, the Bank uses qualitative and supplementary quantitative analysis \nwhere applicable. Sources of hedge ineffectiveness between the hedged items and h edging \ninstruments, can arise from:  \n \n- Differences in timing of cash flows.  \n- Different applied discount interest rate curves.  \n- Non-nil fair value of derivatives at the designation date.  \n- The effect of changes in counterparties’ credit risk on the fair values.  \n \nThe Bank discontinues hedge accounting prospectively only when the hedging relationship (or a \npart thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable) or the hedging \ninstrument expires or is sold, terminated or exerc ised.  \n \nThe notional amounts and fair values of the derivative instruments designated are disclosed \nseparately in Note 14. Hedge accounting disclosures are provided in Note 5.  \n \n 3.9.1.1 Fair value hedges  \n \nApplying fair value hedge accounting enables the Bank to reduce fair value fluctuations of \nthe recognized fixed rate financial liabilities as if they were floating rate instruments linked \nto the attributable benchmark rates, thus hedging the exposure that is attributable to \ninterest rate risk/foreign cur rency risk and could affect reported earnings.  \n \nThe Bank only hedges changes due to interest rates, such as benchmark rates, which are \ntypically the most significant component of the overall fair value change. The Bank \nassesses hedge effectiveness by compa ring fair value movements of the hedging \ninstruments and the hedged items attributable to changes in these benchmark rates . \n \nFor designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the \nqualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss whereas the carrying value \nof a hedged item that is not already measured at fair value, is adjusted for the fair value \nchange attributable to the hedged risk in the statement of financial position (“'Borrowings”'), \nwith a corre sponding entry in profit or loss. The Bank recognizes the hedging gains or \nlosses from the hedging instrument in profit or loss, in the same line as the adjustment for \nthe hedged item (“ net fair value gains (losses) on derivative instruments”). Accordingly , \nany ineffective part is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  \n \nUpon discontinuation of hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment to the carrying \namount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk, is amortized to profit or loss from \nthat date, based on how the hedged item impacts profit or loss. If the hedged item is \nderecognized, the unamortized fair value hedge adjustment included in the carrying \namount of the hedged item is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  \n \n 3.9.1.2 Cash flow hedges  \n \nApplying cash flow hedge accounting, the Bank hedges the exposure to the variability in \ncash flows attributable to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk associated with a \nrecognized liability that could affect reported earnings.  \n \nThe effective port ion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in Other \nComprehensive Income (OCI) and presented in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity \n(“Cash Flow Hedge Reserve”), whereas any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value \nof the  derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss (“ Unrealized net fair value gains \n(losses) on derivative instruments”).  \n \n \n \n \n 28 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n \nThe amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is limited to the cumulative fair \nvalue hedge of the hedged item from the inception of the He dge less any amounts recycled \nto profit or loss.  \n \nFor assessing the hedge effectiveness, the hypothetical derivative approach is applied, \nwhich involves establishing a notional deri vative that would be the ideal hedging \ninstrument for the hedged exposure (i.e. swap with a zero fair value at inception of the \nhedge relationship with the same critical terms as the hedged items) and then use as a \nproxy for measuring hedge effectiveness, the comparison between the cumulative \nchanges in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative and the fair value of the actual \nhedging instrument.  \n \nProvided that the hedged cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the Bank \nimmediately reclassifies the amount in the cash flow hedge reserve from OCI to profit or \nloss, however on hedge discontinuations, if the hedged cash flows are still expected to \noccur, then the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is not reclassified until  \nthe hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.  \n \n3.10 Financial Guarantees  \n \nIssued financial guarantees are initially recognized at their fair value, being the premium (fee) received and \nsubsequently measured at the higher of the unamortized balance of the related fees received and deferred, \nand the expenditure required to settle the commitment at the financial position date. The latter is recognized \nwhen it is both probable that the guarantee will require to be settled and that the settlement amount can  \nbe reliably estimated. Financial guarantees are recognized within other financial assets and other financial \nliabilities.  \n \n3.11 Property and Equipment  \n \nProperty and equipment include leasehold improvements and transportation and other equipment. \nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost, which includes all costs that are required to bring an \nasset into operating condition. Subsequently to initial recognition, property and equipment are measured \nat cost less accumulated depreciation and accumula ted impairment losses.  \n \nCosts incurred subsequently to the acquisition of an asset, which is classified as property and equipment \nare capitalized, only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Bank beyond \nthose originall y anticipated for the asset, otherwise they are expensed as incurred.  \n \nAt each reporting date the Bank assesses whether there is any indication that an item of property and \nequipment may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Bank estimates the re coverable amount of \nthe asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is \nwritten down immediately to its recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of property and  \nequipment are determined by refere nce to their carrying amount and are taken into account in determining \nnet income or loss.  \n \nDepreciation is provided to write off the cost of each asset to their residual values on a straight -line basis \nover their estimated useful lives. The annual depreci ation rates applied were as follows:  \n \n- Expenditure on leasehold buildings and improvements are \ndepreciated over the remaining term of the lease  \n- Transportation vehicles  \n- Furniture and office accessories  \n- Personal computers  \n- Office and telecommunication equipment   \n- \n20.0%  \n20.0%  \n33.3%  \n20.0%  \n \n \n \n \n \n 29 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n3.12 Intangible Assets  \n \nIntangible assets comprise software expenditures and other intangible assets. These assets are amortized \non a straight -line basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, which is software for desktops of three \nyears and software for servers of five y ears. At each reporting date, management reviews intangible assets \nand assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indications exist an analysis is \nperformed to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is fully recoverabl e. A write -down is \nmade if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.  \n \n3.13 Right of Use Assets  \n \nRight -of-use assets comprise those assets that the Bank, as the lessee, has control of the underlying \nassets during the term of the lease. Control is considered to exist if the Bank has:  \n \n- The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified \nasset; and  \n- The right to direct the use of that asset.  \n \nThe Bank provides for the recognition of a right -of-use asset and a lease liability upon lease \ncommencement in case that there is a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys to the Bank the right to \nuse an asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration. More details are provided within the lease \naccounting policy Note 3.2 1. \n \n3.14 Taxation  \n \nIn accordance with Article 52 of the Establishing Agreement, the Bank, its assets, property, income and its \noperations and transactions are exempt from all taxation and all customs duties in all Member Countries.  \n \nThe Bank is also exempt from any obligati on for payment, withholding or collection of any tax or duty. Also, \nno tax shall be levied on salaries or emoluments paid by the Bank to employees. These tax exemptions \nare also included and elaborated upon in Article 12 of the Headquarters Agreement with the Hellenic \nGovernment, ratified by Greek Law 2380/No.38/7.3.1996.  \n \n3.15 Provisions  \n \nThe Bank records provisions for present  obligations and risks when the following circumstances exist (a) \nthere is an existing legal or constructive obligation as a result  of past events (b) for the obligation to be \nsettled an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is present  and (c) a reliable estimate of the \namount of the obligation can be made.  \n \n3.16 Share Capital and Dividends  \n \nIn accordance with Article 36 of  the Establishing Agreement, the Board of Governors shall determine \nannually what part of net income or surplus of the Bank from operations shall be allocated to reserves, \nprovided that no part of the net income or surplus of the Bank shall be distributed to members by way of \nprofit until the general reserves of the Bank shall have attained the level of 10% of the subscribed capital \nincluding all paid, unpaid but payable, and unpaid but callable share capital.  \n \n3.17 Reserves and Retained Earnings  \n \nIn accordance with the Establishing Agreement of the Bank the general reserve is created from the profits \nof the Bank for meeting any unforeseeable risks or contingencies.  The revaluation reserve represents the \naccumulated change in fair value of those fin ancial assets that are measured at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income of the Bank.  The retained earnings of the Bank is the accumulated undistributed \nand unallocated net income over the years.  \n \n \n \n \n 30 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n3.18 Income and Expense  \n \nInterest income and expense are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method. \nThe effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or \nreceipts through the expected  life of the financial instrument (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to:  \n \n- The gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or  \n- The amortized cost of the financial liability.  \n \nWhen calculating the EIR for financial instruments other than purchased or  originated credit -impaired \nassets the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, \nbut not the ECL. For purchased or originated credit -impaired financial assets, a credit -adjusted EIR is \ncalculated using estimated future cash flows including the ECL.  \n \nThe calculation of the EIR includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of \nthe effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attribut able to the \nacquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.  \n \ni) Amortized cost (AC) and gross carrying amount  \n \nThe AC of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial \nliability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the \ncumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial \namount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any ECL allowance.  The \ngross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the AC of a financial asset before adjusting for any \nECL allowance.  \n \nii) Calculation of interest income and expense  \n \nInterest income and expense are recognized in the income statement for all interest  bearing \ninstruments using the effective interest rate method. Interest income includes interest on loans and \nadvances to customers, coupons earned on fixed income investment securities and accrued \ndiscount and premium on treasury bills and other i nstruments.  \n \nFees and direct costs relating to a loan origination or acquiring an investment security, financing \nor restructuring and to loan commitments are deferred and amortized to interest income over the \nlife of the instrument using the effective inte rest rate method.  \n \nOnce a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of \nan impairment loss, interest income is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the \nfuture cash flows for the purpose of mea suring the impairment loss.  \n \nThe EIR of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition of a financial \nasset or a financial liability. In calculating interest income and expense, the EIR is applied to the \ngross carrying amount  of the asset (when the asset is not credit -impaired) or to the AC of the \nliability. The EIR is revised as a result of periodic re -estimation of cash flows of floating rate \ninstruments to reflect movements in market rates of interest.  \n \nHowever, for financial assets that have become credit -impaired subsequent to initial recognition, \ninterest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the net balance of the financial \nasset. If the asset is no longer credit -impaired, th en the calculation of interest income reverts to \nthe gross basis.  \n \nFor financial assets that were credit -impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated \nby applying the credit -adjusted EIR to the AC of the financial asset. The calculation of  interest \nincome does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the financial asset improves.  \n \nOther interest income/expense includes interest on derivatives in economic hedge using the \ncontractual interest rate.  \n \n 31 \n  Notes to the Financial State ments  \n \niii) Fees and commissions  \n \nFee and commission income and expense that are integral to the EIR on a financial asset or \nfinancial liability are included in the EIR. Other fee and commission income – including account \nservicing fees, investment management fees, sales commission, placement fees and syndication \nfees – is recognized as the related services are performed. If a loan commitment is not expected \nto result in the draw -down of a loan, then the related loan commitment fee is recognized on a  \nstraight -line basis over the commitment period.  \n \nA contract with a customer that results in a recognized financial instrument in the Bank’s financial \nstatements may be partially in the scope of IFRS 9 and partially in the scope of IFRS 15. If this is \nthe case, then the Bank first applies IFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that \nis in the scope of IFRS 9 and then applies IFRS 15 to the residual.  \n  \nFee and commission income from contracts with customers under the scope of IFRS 15 is \nmeasured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Bank recognizes \nrevenue when it transfers control over a service to a customer. The adoption of IFRS 15 had no \nimpact on the Bank’s financial statements as the execution and co mpletion of the transaction \nrequested by a customer is done at point in time, and this is consistent with the Bank’s existing \naccounting policy.  \n \nOther fee and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are \nexpensed as the ser vices are received.  \n \niv) Interest rate benchmark reform  \n \nAt present the Bank is continuing the usage of Libor as the interest rate benchmark of which the \nBank is exposed to, as there is uncertain ty to the timing and precise form of the new benchmark \nthat has y et to be finalized. The adoption will not have any material impact on the Bank’s financial \nstatements.  \n \n3.19 Staff Retirement and Termination Benefits  \n \nThe Bank has established a pension plan, where the fund’s assets are held separately from the Bank’s \nown assets, for all its eligible employees, consisting of three pillars:  \n \na. The first pillar is a defined post -employment benefit scheme financed entirely by the Bank. \nThe scheme’s funding level and the Bank’s contributions are determined on the basis  of \nactuarial valuations performed by qualified, independent actuaries on an annual basis at \nthe end of each annual reporting period. The actuarial valuation uses the projected unit \ncredit method and a number of financial and demographic assumptions. The m ost \nsignificant assumptions include age, years of service or compensation, life expectancy, \nthe discount rate, expected salary increases and pension rates. The actuarial liability is \nthe present value of the defined benefit obligation as at the reporting d ate minus the fair \nvalue of the plan assets. The Bank is under the obligation to maintain the scheme fully \nfunded, and to this effect, has always liquidated any past service deficit over the course of \nthe year following the relevant actuarial valuation.  \n \nActuarial and asset gains or losses are recognized in ‘Other comprehensive income’, and \nnet gains or losses are included in remeasurements where any change in the effect of the \nasset ceiling, excluding those amounts that have been already included in person nel \nexpenses, are also included.  \n \nb. The second pillar is a defined post -employment contribution scheme to which both the \nemployee and the Bank contribute equally at a rate of 0 -12% of basic salary. The Bank \nhas no obligation to pay further contribution if the employee discontinues their contribution.  \nEach employee determines his/her contribution rate and the mode of investment of the \ncontributions.  \n \n \n 32 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nc. The third pillar is a defined contribution scheme funded  entirely by each employee, up to \n40% of basic salary and is not recorded in the Bank’s financial statements.  \n \nAs an alternative, staff are entitled to retirement benefits from the Greek State Social Insurance Fund \n(EFKA), which is a defined contribution s cheme.  \n \nCurrent service costs in respect of both the pension plan (a) and (b) and EFKA are recognized as an \nexpense in the period which they relate and are included in ‘Personnel expenses’.  \n \nThe Bank may offer termination benefits to employees that are sep arated based on the Bank’s separation \npolicy. These benefits, including indemnities and any related retirement benefits, are recognized in income \nas an expense in the same period they are incurred.  \n \n3.20 Related Parties  \n \nRelated parties include entities, which the Bank has the ability to exercise significant influence in making \nfinancial and operational decisions. Related parities include key management personnel, and close family \nmembers of key management personnel.  \n \n3.21 Leases – the Bank as a Lessee  \n \nOn 1 January 2019 the Bank adopted IFRS 16, ‘Leases’.  This Standard has established the principles for \nthe recognition, measurement and presentation of leases, and provides a single lessee accounting model \nthat is required at the commencement date  of the lease. The objective is to report information that (a) \nfaithfully represents lease transactions and (b) provides a basis for the amount, timing and uncertainty of \ncash flows arising from leases. The Bank as a lessee is required to recognize right -of-use assets \n(representing the Bank’s right to use the underlying leased assets) and a lease liability (representing the \nBank’s obligation to make lease payments), in the statement of financial position.  \n \nThe Bank applied the practical expedient in IFRS 16  to contracts that were identified as leases in order to \ndetermine whether an arrangement contains a lease, on transition to contracts that were previously \nidentified as leases under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. Consequently, the Bank’s leases are only for office s pace;  \nand does not lease land, corporate vehicles, or technical or IT equipment, nor does the Bank have any \nsale-and-leaseback transactions. The Bank elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach, \nwithout restatement of comparative figure s. Under this approach, the Bank was able to choose on a lease \nby lease basis to measure the right -of-use asset at the same amount as the lease liability.  \n \nThe Bank’s leases for right -of-use assets are initially recognized and measured at cost similarly to other \nnon-financial assets, and the lease liability is initially recognized and measured at the present value of \nfuture lease payments that are not paid at that date similarly to other financial liabilities. The lease payments \ncan be discounte d using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if such is available, or alternatively the Bank’s \nincremental borrowing rate. The Bank will apply this measurement – except for those with lease term of 12 \nmonths or less, making use of the shot -term leases and leases of low value, exemptions under this \nStandard.  \n \nRegarding subsequent measurement, the Bank acting as a lessee, has applied the cost model for the \nmeasurement of the right -of-use asset; where this asset is measured at cost, less any accumulated \ndepreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for the remeasurement of the lease \nliability. The lease liability is measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect any interest on it and  \nthat is separately recognized as an expense; th e lease liability’s carrying amount is reduced to reflect the \nlease payments made. In case of any reassessments (e.g. a change in future lease payments resulting \nfrom a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments) or lease modifications (e. g. a change \nin the lease term, lease conditions or any penalty) specified, the carrying amount of the lease liability will \nbe remeasured to reflect revised lease payments.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 33 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n \n4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION \nUNCERTAINTY  \n \nThe preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires M anagement to make judgements, estimates \nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense and \naccompanying notes. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that \nrequire a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities affected in future periods. The \nBank believes that the significant  judgments, e stimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its \ncondensed interim financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of the date of \npreparation. The most significant areas, for which critical judgments, estimates and assumption s are \nrequired in applying the Bank’s accounting policies, are the following:  \n \na. Fair value  estimates for financials instruments carried at fair value.   \n \nb. The Bank’s method for determining the level of impairment of loan operations is described \nwithin the Accounting and further explained in Note 5  Risk Management – credit risk  \nsection. In accordance with IFRS 9, ECL represents the average credit losses weigh ted \nby the probabilities of default (PD), whereby credit losses are defined as the present value \nof all cash shortfalls. The ECL is calculated for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 loans by applying \nthe provision rate to the projected exposure at default (EAD), and  discounting the resulting \nprovision using the loan’s effective interest rate (EIR). The provision rate is generated by \nmultiplying the PD rate and the loss given default (LGD) rate applicable to the loan.  \n \nA number of critical accounting estimates are therefore made in the calculation of \nimpairment of loan operations as follows:  \n \n• Criteria used for staging assessment of loans and advances to customers.  \n• Assumptions for future cashflows of individually assessed credit -impaired \nexposures.  \n• The input and assumptions used to estimate the impact of multiple economic  \nscenarios.  \n \nFor loans that are individually assessed which have a lifetime ECL and that are credit -\nimpaired  in Stage 3 , the impairment allowance results from the impairment test that i s \nconducted on the basis of objective evidence obtained through a risk asset review process. \nAn impairment test includes projected cash in -flows and out -flows, available for debt \nservice until maturity, which are discounted at the original effective intere st rate (EIR) to \nreach a net present value for a particular operation, less any collateral that can be realized . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 34 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n \n4.1 Covid -19 \n \nThe continuation of the Covid -19 pandemic means that the Bank could face additional credit, market and \noperational risks. The duration of the pandemic is difficult to predict at this time, as are the extent and \neffectiveness of economic interventions by th e governments and central banks in the region of the Bank ’s \noperations. The Bank continues to monitor the developments and to manage the risks associated with the \nBank’s various portfolios within existing financial policies and constraints. The two main ar eas that affect \nthe Bank’s judgement and estimate s are: \n \n1. The Bank’s equity investments which will likely see a reduced fair value due to the \ndownward pressure, although the Bank has a small portfolio such investments, and \ntherefore the Bank’s profitability will not be materially impacted.  \n \n2. The Bank’s loan portfolio due to business disruption that can occur in economic activity in \nthe region will put pressure for borrowers, affecting those operating primarily in the service \nand consumer goods in dustries. This could likely force debt restructuring and an increase \nin defaults among less robust operations.  The Bank’s profitability could be impacted by a \nsevere increase in ECL on performing loans, driven by worsening of the macro -economic \noutlook sce narios.  \n \nWith regard of the Bank’s operational risk the information technology (IT) systems have proven they are \nstable, powerful and flexible, as the majority of the Bank’s staff were working successfully remotely. The \nBank is also investing in new IT infrastructure to expand digital and cloud transformation, as well as \nstrengthening the Bank’s cybersecurity and internal control systems.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 35 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n5. RISK MANAGEMENT  \n \nThe Bank’s activities are subject to a variety of risks, some of which are not within the Bank’s control: \nincluding risks relating to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, declines in liquidity and \ndeterioration in the credit quality of its lo an portfolio. The Bank monitors and manages the maturities of its \nloans, its interest rate and exchange rate exposure, its liquidity position and the credit quality of each \nindividual loan and equity investment in order to minimize the effects of changes i n them relative to the \nBank’s profitability and liquidity position. The BoD has approved risk management policies and guidelines \nthat are delegated to the Management of the Bank for the identification and measurement of risk, as well \nas being subject to ri sk limits and controls.  \n \nTo manage risks the Bank has established an Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), a Credit Committee \n(CC) that implement the Bank’s credit and lending policies, the Legal Affairs Department , the  Risk \nManagement Department and the Financial Analysis Department, which together are responsible for \ndevising, implementing and monitoring the Bank’s risk management policies, including financial, credit and \nmarket risks.  \n \nThe ALCO is responsible for monitoring and managing the Bank’s overal l asset and liability position in \naccordance with the Bank’s treasury policies. It monitors and manages the Bank’s liquidity position, \nmaturity gaps, interest income and expense and the condition of the international financial markets and is \nresponsible fo r assigning market risk limits. The ALCO consists of members of the Bank’s Management \nand a member of the Treasury Department and has regular monthly meetings.  \n \nThe Credit Committee is responsible with respect to credit matters. Its key responsibilities include: approval \nof lending operations for submission to the BoD for final approval, establishing specific parameters (e.g. \npolicies, limits, targets, guidelines) for operational decision -making, approval of changes to the manuals \nthat pr escribe how operations are to be analyzed, approved, administered and monitored and approval of \nany amendments, restructuring and other operation -related matters. The Credit Committee consists of \nmembers of the Bank’s Management, and has regular meetings a s required to monitor and manage overall \nrisk concentration by reference to borrower and industry exposure and critically reviews each individual \nloan and equity investment proposal made by the lending business areas. A major function of the Credit \nCommitt ee is to minimize the credit risk presented by each individual loan and equity investment proposal, \nand the overall portfolio risk of the Bank.  \n \nOnce an operation is approved and disbursed, it is then monitored to ensure thorough and regular \nevaluations of  its credit quality. Operations are monitored according to a schedule coordinated by the of \nProject Implementation and Monitoring  Department , with inputs from the originating Operation Teams \nregarding the availability of financial data. Monitoring reports are completed by the Bank’s Project \nImplementation and Monitoring Department based on financial analysis prepared by the Financial Analysis  \nDepartment . Risk asset reviews, based on the previously mentioned monitoring reports, are performed by \nthe Risk Mana gement  Department , and may result in a downgrade or upgrade of an operation’s status \nand, if a significant deterioration is noted, trigger an impairment test.  \n \nShould an operation display signs of weakness during the regular monitoring and/or through risk asset \nreviews, an impairment test is immediately carried out by the Risk Management Department and \nappropriate remedial actions are taken, as required. These measures include, but are not limited to, a \ndetailed assessment of the financial and operational p erformance of the operation, additional due diligence, \nstopping disbursement of any undisbursed amounts, preparation of remedial strategies and carrying out \nfurther impairment tests. Besides, in addition to regular site visits carried out by the Operations  Teams, \nsuch a visit can be conducted by the Project Implementation and Monitoring Department and, when \nappropriate, accompanied by the Financial Analysis  Department . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 36 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n \nFor the Bank a conservative approach to risk taking together with effective risk management, are critical \nto the Bank’s continuing operations. The application of sound banking principles in the Bank’s credit \nprocess seeks to ensure that the significant cre dit risks are properly identified and managed while other \nrisks resulting from its activities are mitigated to the extent possible.  \n \nImportantly, the Bank is recognized as an international financial institution, and as such can expect to \nbenefit from the p referred creditor status customarily and historically afforded to such institutions. This \npreferred creditor status serves to provide an additional layer of comfort against the risks of non -payment \non sovereign debt or by private sector borrowers as a resu lt of local laws creating a delay or freeze on \nforeign -currency exchanges. T he Bank is exposed to the following risks discussed below.  \n \n \nFinancial Risk  \n \nThe Bank’s exposure to financial risk is through its financial assets and financial liabilities includi ng any \nreceivables from these financial assets. The key aspects of the Bank’s financial risk are (i) credit risk (ii) \nliquidity risk and (iii) market risk.  \n \na) Credit risk  \n \nThe Bank is subject to credit risk, which is the risk that customers or counterparties will be unable to meet \ntheir obligations as they fall due. Credit risk arises principally from the Bank’s lending activities as well as \nother activities where the Bank is exposed to counterparty default risk. Regular reviews by the departmen ts \nof Risk Management, Financial Analysis and Project Implementation and Monitoring are conducted of all \nexposures within the lending portfolios, typically on a semi -annual basis, though exposures that are \nperceived to be more vulnerable to possible defaul t are reviewed more frequently.  \n \nAt each review there is (i) an assessment of whether there has been any change in the risk profile of the \nexposure (ii) recommendations of actions to mitigate risk and (iii) reconfirming or adjusting the risk ratings, \nand f or equity investments, reviewing of fair value. Where relevant, the level of the expected credit loss is \nevaluated and reconfirmed or adjusted. Responsibility for operations considered to be in jeopardy may be \ntransferred from the original lending departme nt to a corporate recovery team in order to most effectively \nmanage the restructuring and recovery process.  \n \nFor credit risks incurred by the Bank’s Treasury in its investment and hedging activities, the BoD has \napproved policies and guidelines for the det ermination of counterparty and investment exposure limits in \nbonds, that includes member state bonds, and euro commercial paper. The Bank’s Risk Management \nDepartment assigns and monitors these counterparty and issuer credit risk limits. Treasury credit ri sks are \nalso reviewed on a regular basis by the Bank’s A LCO. \n \nThe table below summarizes the maximum exposure to credit risk without taking into consideration \ncollateral, other credit enhancements or provisions of impairment.  \n \n \n \nPresented in EUR (000)  At \n31 December  \n2021 At \n31 December  \n2020 \nCash and due from banks  \nDeposits in margin accounts  \nDebt investment securities  \nDerivative financial instruments  \nLoans  \nEquity investments  \nAccrued interest receivable  \nOther assets  170,175 \n30,740 \n652,448 \n24,279 \n2,344,438 \n25,777 \n27,181 \n15,954 34,328 \n26,240  \n687,961 \n26,701 \n2,042,921 \n26,310  \n23,512  \n9,490 \nOn-balance -sheet  \nUndrawn commitments  3,290,992 \n237,471 2,877,463 \n274,031 \nTotal  3,528,463 3,151,494 \n \n 37 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \na1.

This limit is calculated on the basis of the BoD approved \noperations, minus repayments and cancellations. Individual operations are further constrained by the \nSingle Obligor Limit and by monitoring of Sectoral Exposure.  \n \na6. Collateral and credit enhancements  \n \nThe Bank mitigates credit risk by holding collateral and other credit enhancements against exposure to \ncustomers and counterparties where it believes such security is necessary. The Bank defines security as \nmechanisms, procedures and assets negotiated in transactions that are meant to protect it against loss in \ncase of non -performance. Security includes, but is not limited to, material assets, financial instruments, \nguarantees, covenants and comfort letters.  \n \n• Loans and advances. The BoD approved guidelines for taking security under lending operations , \nset the levels and types of collateral and other credit enhancements recommended for a given ri sk \nprofile.  \n \nThe main types of collateral that may be obtained by the Bank are: mortgages on properties and \nequipment, pledges of equity shares and investment instruments, assignment of rights on certain \ncontracts, cash or blocked deposits and other third party guarantees. If necessary, the Bank \nreassesses the value of collateral in order to determine if additional collateral is needed to be \nprovided by the borrower. At 31 December 202 1 the secured portfolio was 55.8% (2020: 53.9%) \nof the outstanding loans balance.  \n \n• Other financial instruments. Collateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and \nadvances is determined by the nature of the instrument. Bonds and euro commercial paper held \nby the Bank as investment securities  are generally unsecured. The Bank may hold cash or \ngovernment securities as collateral against its derivative contract counterparties. At 31 December \n2021 the Bank had pledged as collateral for derivative transactions a net amount of EUR 14,150  \nthousand ( 2020: EUR 3,320 thousand).  \n \n• For loans that are credit -impaired at the reporting date the Bank has collateral held as security , an \namount of EUR 38,864 thousand to mitigate credit risk. The types of collateral with approximate \nvalues are real estate EUR 21, 782 thousand, machinery and equipment EUR 6,175  thousand, and \npledged shares EUR 10,907  thousand.  \n \nb)  Liquidity risk  \n \nLiquidity risk arises in the general funding of the Bank’s financing and investment activities and in the \nmanagement of positions. It concerns the ability of the Bank to fulfill its financial obligations as they become \ndue and is a measure of the extent to  which the Bank may require funds to meet those obligations. It \ninvolves both the risk of unexpected increases in the cost of funding the portfolio of assets at appropriate \nmaturities and rates and the risk of being unable to liquidate a position in a time ly manner on reasonable \nterms.  \n \nThe Bank’s liquidity policy aims to balance the term and currency structure of the Bank’s assets and \nliabilities. Liquidity management is concentrated on the timing of cash in -flows and out -flows, as well as \nthe adequacy of available cash and liquid securi ties. The Bank maintains liquid assets at prudential levels \nto ensure that cash can quickly be made available to honor all its obligations, even under adverse \nconditions  and that  the Bank has access to the funds necessary to satisfy customer needs, maturin g \nliabilities and its own working capital requirements. For this, the Bank estimates all expected cash flows \nfrom assets and liabilities.  \n \nThe Bank takes into consideration, to the extent feasible, the guidance documents issued by the Basel \nCommittee on Ba nking Supervision. The Bank sets limits to control its liquidity risk exposure and \nvulnerabilities and regularly reviews such limits. The limit framework includes also measures ensuring that \nin a period of market stress, available liquidity exceeds liquidi ty needs so that the Bank can continue to \noperate.  \n \n 42 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nThe Bank’s commitment to maintaining a strong liquidity position is established in policies approved by the \nBoD.  The liquidity policy requires that the Bank maintain its liquidity position at a minimum of 50% of the \nfollowing 12  months’ net cash requireme nt, including committed undisbursed project and trade finance \nloans.  \n \nThe Bank’s liquidity position is monitored regularly, and the ALCO is primarily responsible for the \nmanagement of liquidity risk and the liquidity profile of the Bank. The Bank’s liquid assets are maintained \nin short -term and negotiable securities that primarily are: (i) cash and bank balances (ii)  short term deposits   \nwith investment grade rated counterparties (iii)  Euro -denominated commercial paper issued by investment \ngrade parties and  (iv) investment grade bonds.  \n \nThe table below presents the maturity profile of the undiscounted cash flows for financial liabilities placed \nbased on the remaining period from the financial position date to the contractual maturity date.

Market risk arises on such instruments that are valued at \ncurrent market prices (mark to market basis) or those valued at cost plus any accrued interest (accruals \nbasis).  \n \nThe Bank funds its  operations by using the Bank’s own share capital and by borrowing on the international \ncapital markets. The Bank aims to match, wherever possible, the currencies, tenors and interest rate \ncharacteristics of its borrowings with those of its lending portfol ios. When necessary, the Bank uses \nderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate risks.  \n \nThe Board has approved risk management policies and limits within which exposure to market risk is \nmonitored, measured and controlle d. The ALCO monitors and manages these risks while the asset and \nliability function within the Treasury Department has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with \nthese policies and limits.  \n \nc1. Foreign exchange risk  \n \nThe Bank’s risk management policies seek to minimize currency exposures or any unanticipated changes, \nfavorable or unfavorable, in foreign exchange rates that could affect the income statement, by requiring \nnet liabilities in any one currency to be matched closely with ne t assets in the same currency. The Bank \nwill not take discretionary currency positions. This is achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds \nof the Bank’s borrowings in the currencies in which they were borrowed.  \n 43 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n \nThe Bank regularly monitors its assets and liabilities in order to ensure the Bank takes no significant foreign \nexchange risks and, after swap activities, adjusts the net asset currency composition to the Bank’s \nfunctional currency to maintain a matched foreign exchange position. As a matter of policy, the Bank aims \nto keep foreign exchange exposure as close to zero as possible, with exceptions to this practice requiring \napproval from the ALCO. For local currency transactions the Bank matches the operatio n’s currency with \nborrowings in the same currency, as such there is no material exposure. The t ables below provide a \ncurrency breakdown of the Bank’s assets and liabilities, showing that the effect of any currency fluctuations \non the net exposure is minima l. \n \nAt 31 December 202 1 \n \nPresented in EUR (000)   \n \nEuro  United \nStates  \ndollar   \nSwiss  \nfranc   \n \nOther   \n \nTotal  \nAssets  \n     Cash and due from banks  \n     Deposits in margin accounts  \n     Debt investment securities  \n     Derivative financial instruments  \n     Loans  \n     Deferred income  \n     Impairment losses on loans  \n     Equity investments  \n     Accrued interest receivable       \n     Other assets   \n79,921 \n30,740 \n375,444 \n7,914 \n1,565,941 \n(9,724) \n(38,510) \n12,588 \n12,830  \n13,293  \n88,793 \n- \n277,004 \n15,394  \n703,859 \n(4,694) \n(1,574) \n13,109 \n8,103 \n2,168  \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n331  \n1,461 \n- \n- \n971 \n74,638 \n(282) \n(4,139) \n80 \n6,248 \n162  \n170,175 \n30,740 \n652,448 \n24,279 \n2,344,438 \n(14,700) \n(44,223) \n25,777 \n27,181 \n15,954 \nTotal  \n \nLiabilities  \n     Borrowings  \n     Margin accounts  \n     Derivative financial instruments  \n     Other and lease liabilities  2,050,437 \n \n \n443,098 \n16,590 \n29,261 \n10,300 1,102,162 \n \n \n998,702 \n- \n16,608  \n- 331 \n \n \n339,530 \n- \n- \n- 79,139 \n \n \n493,071 \n- \n- \n- 3,232,069 \n \n \n2,274,401 \n16,590 \n45,869 \n10,300 \nTotal  \n 499,249 1,015 ,310 339,530 493,071 2,347,160 \nCurrency balance at 31 December 20 21 1,551,188 86,852 (339,199) (413,932) 884,909 \n \n \n \nAt 31 December 2020  \n \nPresented in EUR (000)   \n \nEuro  United \nStates  \ndollar   \nSwiss  \nfranc   \n \nOther   \n \nTotal  \nAssets  \n     Cash and due from banks  \n     Deposits in margin accounts  \n     Debt investment securities  \n     Derivative financial instruments  \n     Loans  \n     Deferred income  \n     Impairment losses on loans  \n     Equity investments  \n     Accrued interest receivable       \n     Other assets   \n6,507 \n26,240  \n485,640 \n2,667 \n1,275,916 \n(9,336) \n(48,495) \n10,851 \n7,596  \n6,372  \n26,785  \n- \n202,321 \n23,141 \n562,747 \n(3,988) \n(3,083) \n15,374 \n9,580  \n2,308  \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n16 \n535  \n1,036  \n- \n- \n893 \n204,258 \n(489) \n(4,359) \n85 \n6,320  \n275  \n34,328 \n26,240  \n687,961 \n26,701 \n2,042,921 \n(13,813) \n(55,937) \n26,310 \n23,512  \n9,490 \nTotal  \n \nLiabilities  \n     Borrowings  \n     Margin accounts  \n     Derivative financial instruments  \n     Other and lease liabilities  1,763,958 \n \n \n342,087 \n22,920  \n15,812 \n11,742 835,185 \n \n \n1,042,201 \n- \n10,107  \n- 551 \n \n \n185,697 \n- \n- \n- 208,019 \n \n \n331,729 \n- \n3,016  \n- 2,807,713 \n \n \n1,901,714 \n22,920  \n28,935  \n11,742 \nTotal  \n 392,561 1,052,308 185,697 334,745 1,965,311 \nCurrency balance at 31 December 20 20 1,371,397 (217,123) (185,146)  (126,726) 842,402 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 44 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nc2. Interest rate risk  \n \nInterest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate, favorably or unfavorably, \ndue to changes in market interest rates. The length of time for which the rate of interest is determined on \na financial instrument indicates to what extent it is exposed to that interest rate risk.  \n \nThe Bank’s interest rate risk management activities aim to enhance profitability, by limiting the effect on \nasset values of adverse interest rate movements in order to increase net interest income by managing \ninterest rate exposure. The majority of the Bank’s loan portfolio is variable interest rate and the Bank has \na policy aimed at minimizing interest rate mismatches between its assets and liabilities that seeks to ensure \nthat the interest rate payment periods for its liabilities are matched as closely as pos sible to interest rate \npayment periods for the Bank’s assets. As a matter of policy, the Bank does not take discretionary interest \nrate positions.  \n \nThe tables below provide information of the Bank’s interest rate risk exposure on non -trading financial \nassets and liabilities.

Sensitivity analysis  \n \n Currency risk sensitivity  \n \nThe Bank is marginally sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations of the US dollar and the Euro. The \nBank’s paid -in capital is held in Euro and the Bank’s loan portfolio is typically denominated as 60% \nEuro, 30% US dollar and 10% other local currencies . In ad dition, the Bank’s administrative \nexpenses are denominated in Euro, and the Bank’s income is typically denominated as 60% Euro, \n30% US dollar  and 10% other local currency . The Bank has addressed this sensitivity to currency \nrisk by increasing its percentag e of loans denominated in Euro, and therefore increasing its Euro \ndenominated income.  \n \nInterest rate sensitivity  \n \nThe Bank’s interest rate sensitivity analysis comprises two elements. Firstly, there is the differential \nbetween the interest rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of borrowing to fund these \nassets. For this element the Bank does, as closely as po ssible, match interest rate periods, thus \nminimizing or even eliminating sensitivity. Secondly, there is the absolute rate earned on assets \nthat are funded by the Bank’s member’s equity resources. The majority of the Bank’s member’s \nequity resources are cu rrently invested in the Bank’s loan portfolio at floating rates; therefore, \nsubjecting earnings on member’s equity resources to a minor degree of fluctuation.  \n \nThe table below details the re -pricing gap by currency. A parallel upward or downward shift in the EUR and \nUSD curves of 50 basis points would have generated the maximum loss or gain respectively.  \n \n \n \nPresented in EUR (000)  At \n31 December  \n2021 At \n31 December  \n2020 \nEuro  \nUnited States dollar  2,142,000 \n(973,000) 1,386,000 \n(43,000) \nTotal re-pricing gap  1,169,000 1,343,000 \n \nShift of 50 basis points in the EUR curve   \n5,846  \n6,716 \n \n \n \n 46 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nc4. Hedges of interest rate risk and foreig n currency risk  \n \nFair value hedges  \n \nThe Bank uses pay floating/receive fixed interest rate and cross -currency interest rate swaps to \nhedge the interest rate and foreign currency risks, deriving from its issuance of both Euro and \ndenominated in foreign currencies debt (mainly USD,  AUD  and RON). The Bank hedges  interest \nrate risk to the extent of the benchmark interest rate exposure of the floating leg (mainly Euribor, \nUSD Libor). Provided that the aforementioned exposures satisfy the hedge accounting criteria \n(please see Note 3.9.1), these are designated in fai r value hedges.  \n \nUpon designation, the fair value change on the qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in \nprofit or loss. Also, the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is \nrecogni zed in the same line item in profit or loss. If the carrying amount of the hedged item is not \nalready measured at fair value (measured at cost or amorti zed cost), then it is adjusted accordingly, \nwith a corresponding entry. The Bank recognizes any ineffective portion of the fair value  hedge \nrelationships in profit and loss under the “Unrealized net fair value gains (losses) on derivative \ninstruments ” line item.  \n \nUpon hedge discontinuation, any hedging adjustment made to a hedged item for which the \neffective interest method is used, is amorti zed to profit or loss, by adjusting the effective interest \nrate from the date on which amortization begins. If the hedged item is derecogni zed, then the \nadjustment is recogni zed immediately in profit or loss.  \n \nThe Bank establishes a hedge ratio 1:1, by aligning the par amount of the fixed -rate liability and \nthe notional amount of the interest rate and cross currency swap designated as a hedging \ninstrument.

Note 3.9.1 sets out more details on the accounting policy of the cash flow hedges.  \n \nAt 31 December 2021, the Bank designated a pay fixed -receive fixed cross -currency interest rate \nswap (USD:CHF) in cash flow he dge relationship. The hedging instrument’s nominal amount was \nEUR 143,177 thousand, with the corresponding hedged item being Swiss franc notes issued, as \nincluded in the Bank’s statement of financial position (under “Borrowings” line item).  \n \nFor this outstanding hedged designation, the balance in the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to \nEUR  493 thousand loss (2020: nil) (see Note 24).  \n \nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021, there were no amounts related to settled swaps.  \n \n \nC5. Equity price risk \n \nThe Bank has a small equity investments portfolio and as such does not have significant market risk \nexposure concerning foreign exchange or equity price risk on this portfolio. At 31 December 20 21 the \nBank’s equity investments are classified at FVTOC I, except for one, and are primarily unlisted.  \n \nThe Bank takes a long -term approach of its equity investments and has no intention of exiting from any, \ntherefore accepts the short -term volatilities in value from exchange rate and price risk. The Bank expec ts \nthe effect on net income to be of little to no impact.  \n \nAdditional sensitivity information for the Bank’s equity investments has been included under ‘ Fair value \nhierarchy’ later in this section and in the Note “Equity investments ”. \n \n \nOperational Risk  \n \nLike all financial institutions, the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and \nprocesses. Operational risks include the risks of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal \nprocesses, people, systems, legal, and from externa l events which could have a negative financial or \nadverse reputational impact. The Bank h as a low tolerance for losses arising from the operational risks the \nBank is exposed to.  \n \nThe Compliance and Operational Risk Management Department (DCR) has oversight  on operational risk \nactivities across the Bank. The Bank’s operational risk framework is a network of processes, procedures, \nreports and responsibilities that are used to identify, manage and monitor the operational risks of the Bank. \nThese include commit tees, working groups, day -to-day practices such as the collection and analysis of key \nrisks, risk of loss incidents and both strategic and work cultural practices. This provides a structured \napproach to managing operational risk and seeks to apply consiste nt standards and techniques for \nevaluating risks across the Bank. The Bank has a comprehensive set of policies and procedures that \nindicate how operational risks should be managed throughout the Bank.  \n \nThe sources of operational risk emerge in various  ways, including business interruptions, inappropriate \nbehavior of employees (including fraud), failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of \nvendors to perform in accordance with their contractual arrangements. These events could result  in \nfinancial losses, as well as reputational damages to the Bank. The Bank’s operational risk management \nfocuses on proactive measures to mitigate the operational risk.  \n \nWhere any incident may occur t he Bank systematically collects, analyses and reports d ata on that incident \nto ensure the Bank understands the reasons it occurred and how controls can be improved to reduce or \nbetter avoid the risk of any future incident.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 49 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nThe Bank’s risk and control assessments of the key operational risks in each business area are \ncomprehensive  and primarily bottom -up. They are based on Bank -wide operational risk definitions, that \nclassif y risks under a standardize approach, cover the inherent risks of each business area and control \nfunction, provide an evaluation of the effectiveness of the controls in place to mitigate these risks, \ndetermine the residual risk ratings and require a decision to either accept or remediate any remaining risk.  \n \nConcerning cyber crime, wh ich is risk of loss or damage to the Bank’s business areas and customers as a \nresult of actions committed or facilitated through the use of networked information systems, the Bank’s \nInformation Technologies Department (DIT), and information security policies and procedures ensure that \nall servers and computers have up to date antivirus software. Backups are made regularly and regular \naccess control checks, system penetration and vulnerability tests along with disaster recover y tests are \nperformed.  \n \nThe Bank’s anti -cyber attack controls are checked and aligned with industry best practice by the DIT. \n \nThe Bank regularly  produces management information reports covering the key inputs and outputs of \noperational risk. These reports  are used to monitor outcomes against agreed targets and tolerance levels. \nThe Bank utilizes the Bank’s IT systems and other information tools to ensure operational risks are \nidentified and managed properly.  \n \nOverall, the Bank is committed to follow the be st practices and market standards in the area of \naccountability, transparency and business ethics. Due diligence on customers and counterparties take into \nconsideration the Anti -Fraud Corruption and Monetary Laundering Policy and Know -Your Customer \nProcedu res. The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plans, and a disaster recovery off -\nsite which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect the interests of all the key stakeholders \nof the Bank, namely, the member countries, bond holders and other creditors as well as employees and \ntheir families, in the event of any disturbance in office locations.  \n \nFair Value Hierarchy  \n \nFor th e above financial instruments measured at fair value, the Bank uses the following hierarchy for \ndetermining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:  \n \n• Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;  \n \n• Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair  \n value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and  \n \n• Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value  \n that are not based on observable market data.  \n \nThe tables below identify the Bank’s financial instruments measured at fair value.  \n \n \n \nPresented in EUR (000)   \nLevel 1   \nLevel 2   \nLevel 3  Carrying  \nAmount  \nDerivative financial instruments – assets  \nFair value through profit or loss:  \n     Loans  \n     Equity investments  \nFair value through other comprehensive income:  \n     Debt investment securities  \n     Equity investments  \nDerivative financial instruments – liabilities  - \n \n- \n- \n \n652,448 \n- \n- 24,279 \n \n- \n- \n \n- \n \n(45,869) - \n \n15,014 \n791 \n \n- \n24,986 \n- 24,279 \n \n15,014 \n791 \n \n652,448 \n24,986 \n(45,869) \nAt 31 December 20 21 652,448 (21,590) 40,791 671,649 \n \nThere have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.

In December 2007 the BoG approved an increase of the Bank’s authorized share \ncapital to SDR 3 billion and authorized the o ffering of SDR 1 billion to the existing Member States for \nsubscription, with the objective of increasing subscribed capital to a total of SDR 2 billion. The increase \nallows the Bank to implement its operational strategy to a substantial degree. The Bank d oes not have any \nother classes of capital.  \n 52 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nIn October 2008 the above new shares in the amount of SDR 1 billion that were offered for subscription to \nthe Bank’s Member States were fully subscribed and allocated. Accordingly, the Bank’s paid -in share \ncapital was doubled from SDR 300 million to SDR 600 million. The remaining SDR 1 billion of authorized \nshare capital has not yet been allocated.  \n \nPursuant to Resolution 131 of the BoG , that unanimously adopted the firs t amendment to the Establishing \nAgreement, which became effective on 21 June 2013. As of this effective date, and as per Resolution 131 \nof the BoG, the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and all of the Bank’s authorized share capital \nwas redenomina ted from SDR to EUR. The conversion rate applied was SDR to EUR fixed at 1:1.15.  \n \nThe share capital usage of the Bank is guided by statutory and financial policy parameters. Article 15 of \nthe Establishing Agreement limits the total amount of outstanding lo ans, equity investments and \nguarantees made for ordinary operations to 150% of the Bank’s unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves \nand surpluses, establishing a 1.5:1 institutional gearing ratio. Additionally, disbursed equity investments \nshall not at any t ime exceed an amount corresponding to the Bank’s total unimpaired paid -in capital, \nsurpluses and general reserve.  \n \nThe Bank determines required share capital as the potential losses the Bank may incur based on \nprobabilities consistent with the Bank’s credit rating. The main risk categories assessed under the share \ncapital adequacy framework are credit risk, market risk and operational risk, and such total risks are \nmanaged within the available share capital base that excludes callable share capital, wh ile maintaining a \nprudent cushion. A main objective of this framework is to manage the Bank’s share capital by providing a \nconsistent measurement of capital headroom over time. The Bank has no expectation for callable share \ncapital to be called, and will p revent this need and use only available risk share capital as reserves, surplus \nand paid -in. \n \nAt the 36th meeting of the BoD in 2008, the operational gearing ratio was set at 100% of the Bank’s \nunimpaired paid -up capital, reserves and surpluses, and the us able portion of the callable capital. This limit \non the total amount of operations which includes all callable capital is approximately EUR 2. 6 billion.  \n \nOverall, t he Bank preserves an actively managed capital stock to prudently cover risks in its activities. As \na multilateral financial institution, the Bank is not subject to regulatory capital requirements. However, the \nBank uses standards proposed by the Basel II Capital Accord as a benchmark for its risk management and \ncapital framework. Pursuant  to Article 5 of the Establishing Agreement, the BoG shall at intervals of not \nmore than five years review the capital stock of the Bank. In substance, the primary objective of the Bank’s \ncapital management is to ensure adequate share capital is available to support the Bank’s operations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 53 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n \n6. OPERATING SEGMENTS  \n \nThe Bank is a multilateral financial institution, which in accordance with the Establishing Agreement, is \ndedicated to accelerating development and promoting co -operation among the Bank’s shareholder \ncountries. The Bank operates in a specific geographical area and the primary reporting format for business \nsegments are the Lending and Treasury operations. Lending activities  represent investments in projects \nsuch as loans, equity investments and guarantees.

The decrease in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is mainly attributed to the stabilization of \nthe Covid -19 pandemic, driven by modest improvements of macroeconomic variables used for some \nmember countries  as their economies bounced ba ck from the Covid -19 pand emic . The increase amount \nin Stage 3 is due to the deter ioration of a few loans reducing their carrying amount.  \n \nIn 2019 the Bank purchased a portion of a loan in deep discount an amount of EUR 8,278 thousand which \npaid EUR 2,097 thousand  and credited an impairment loss of EUR 6,181 thousand recognized in stage 3 \nrather than purchased  credit impaired, as the loan agreement on the  portion purchased specified that the \ncontractual obligations w ould be identical as that of the Bank’s . \n \nStaging Criteria 12 -month ECL (Stage 1)  \n \nAs IFRS 9 does not distinguish between individually significant or not individually significant financial \ninstruments, the Bank measures potential credit losses for all non -impaired operations (Stage 1 and Stage \n2) on an individual operation basis.  Provisions for impairment in Stage 1 are therefore affected by the \nspecifics of any particular operation together with general market scenarios. They are meant to protect \nagainst potential risks that are consi dered present, or within a 12 -month horizon, and derived from \npotentially adverse developments in operating conditions beyond the control of individual borrowers.  \n \nStaging Criteria Lifetime ECL (Stages 2 and 3)  \n \nWhen an operation deteriorates substantially in credit quality, it enters Stage 2 and an expected credit loss \ncalculation is performed on a Lifetime Expected Credit Loss (LECL) basis. Stage 2 operations are those \nthat have experienced an overall credit quality downgrade but are still pe rforming. They are not considered  \ncredit -impaired.  \n \nStage 3 operations have objective evidence of impairment that immediately impacts the ECL.  \n \n \n \n \n \n 57 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nRevolving Facilities and Undrawn Commitments  \n \nRevolving credit facilities  have no fixed term and they can be cancelled at the discretion of the Bank at any \npoint in time. These facilities are subject to, at a minimum, an annual credit review. In this regard, the date \nof the latest credit review is considered the relevant date to assess if there is any increase in credit risk, as \nat that point in time. Following this, t he Bank may amend the terms and conditions of the exposure.  \n \nThe estimate of the ECLs on irrevocable loan commitments is consistent with its exp ectations of \ndrawdowns on that loan commitment.  Therefore, the Bank considered (i) the expected portion of the loan \ncommitment that will be drawn down within 12 months of the reporting date when estimating 12 -month \nexpected credit losses and (ii) the expe cted portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over \nthe expected life of the reporting date when estimating lifetime expected credit losses. At 31 December \n2021 the amount of expected credit losses was EUR 193 thousand for loan commitments of EUR 2 08,203 \nthousand (20 20: EUR 983 thousand for loan commitments of EUR 245,143 thousand).  \n \n \n13.

With this object ive in mind, the Bank, \ntogether with a number of other institutions has invested in the entities as detailed below.  \n \n \n  At \n31 December  \n2021 At \n31 December  \n2020 \n \nPresented in EUR (000)  % of \nInvestment   \nCost Fair \nValue   \nCost Fair \nvalue  \n     Balkan Accession Fund  9.09 - 791 - 791 \nAt fair value through profit or loss  \n \n     SEAF Caucasus Growth Fund  \n     Access Bank, Azerbaijan  \n     A-Park Kaluga, Russia  \n     Emerging Europe Accession Fund  \n     Rusal  \n     ADM Ceecat Recovery Fund  \n     European Virgin Fund  \n     Teamnet International  \n     Natfood  \n     EOS Hellenic Renaissance Fund   \n \n21.39  \n0.06 \n19.99  \n10.15 \n0.01 \n5.37 \n21.05  \n8.33 \n37.98  \n2.01 - \n \n5,631 \n783 \n1,714  \n2,064 \n4 \n3,750 \n724 \n5,599  \n- \n544 791 \n \n5,494 \n81 \n980 \n6,865 \n363 \n3,190 \n7,251 \n- \n- \n762 - \n \n5,074 \n722 \n1,714  \n2,194 \n4 \n3,901 \n6,253 \n5,599  \n- \n1,055  791 \n \n4,954 \n85 \n940 \n5,685 \n161 \n3,059 \n10,258 \n- \n- \n377 \nAt fair value through other comprehensive income  20,813 24,986 26,516 25,519 \nEquity investments at fair value  20,813 25,777 26,516 26,310 \n \nThe valuation of such investments, which are unlisted, has been estimated using the most recent \nmanagement accounts or the latest audited accounts as of 31 December 20 21, as Management considers \nthat these provide the best available estimate of the investments’ fair value. The techniques applied to \nperform these valuations include equity calculations based on EBITDA and market data.  \n \nDuring the year the  Bank had realized a net income of EUR 182 thousand from its investment in the Balkan \nAccession Fund.  \n \nOn disposal or exit of an equity investment for those at fair value through other comprehensive income, \nthe cumulative gain or loss is realized with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized gain or loss that was \nrecorded prior to the exit from that investment, and is not recycled to the income statement.  \n \nAs of 31 December 20 21 the Bank has a committed amount of EUR 6,833 thousand towards further \nparticipation in the above entities. Further analysis of the equity investment portfolio is presented in the \nNote “Risk management ”. \n \nAs of 31 December 20 21 the Bank has few equity investments where it holds slightly more than 20 per \ncent of the investee share capital, but does not exert significant influence, hence the in vestment s are not \naccounted for as an investment in an associate under IAS 28.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 62 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n \n17.

LEASE LIABILITY  \n \nThe Bank has entered into a lease contract only for its Headquarters premises, which includes renewal \noptions and periodic escalation clauses. There are no other commitments at end of year arising from non -\ncancellable lease contract. On adoption of IFRS 16  the impact in the statement of financial position of the \nrecognition of right -of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, together with the movement for the year , \nis analyzed as follows:  \n \nPresented in EUR (000)  Total  \nLease liability due to initial ap plication of IFRS 16 at 1 January 2019  \nPrepayment of rental  \nInterest expense on the lease liability  \nLease payments recognized in administrative expenses  1,931  \n(196)  \n- \n(676)  \nLease liability at 31 December 2019  \nLease payments recognized in administrative expenses  1,059  \n(676)  \nLease liability at 31 December 2020  \nRenewal of lease term  \nLess payments recognized in administrative expenses  383 \n349 \n(689) \nLease liability at 31 December 20 21 43 \n \nIFRS 16 indicates that at the commencement date, the lessee (the Bank) will discount the lease payment \nusing (a) the interest rate implicit in the lease or (b) the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate if the interest \nrate implicit in the lease cannot be determined. The incremental borro wing rate is the rate of interest that \na lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds to obtain (i) an asset of a similar value to the underlying \nasset (ii) over a similar term (iii) with similar security (iv) in a similar economic environment. As the Bank  \nhas only one lease arrangement that is nearing maturity, Management concluded that any adjustment or \nany subsequent interest does not have a material impact on the financial statements.  \n \nThe Bank presents right -of-use assets separately as property and equ ipment, and the lease liability \nseparately within payables and accrued interest, in the statement of financial position. Consequently, the \nBank recognizes lease payments and interest, if any on the lease liability on a straight -line basis over the \nperiod o f the lease term, similarly to any benefits received or that are receivable, in the income statement. \nWhen a lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payments required to be made to the \nlessor, by way of penalty, are recognized as an ex pense in the period the termination takes place.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 66 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n23. SHARE CAPITAL  \n \nFrom the Bank’s inception, and in accordance with Article 4 of the Establishing Agreement, the Bank \ndenominated its authorized share capital in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF). Resolution 131 of the BoG unanimously adopted the requisite amendments to \nparagraph 1 of Article 4 and Articles 23 and 24 of the Establishing Agreement, to expr essly include among \nthe exclusive powers of the BoG the change of the unit of account of the Bank, and the redenomination of \nall capital stock of the Bank. These amendments to the Establishing Agreement became effective on 21 \nJune 2013 (the ‘Effective Date ’). In accordance with such Resolution 131 of the BoG as of the Effective \nDate the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and the authorized capital stock of the Bank was \nredenominated into three billion four hundred and fifty million EUR (3,450,000,00 0), divided into three \nmillion (3,000,000) shares having a par value of one thousand and one hundred and fifty EUR (1,150) \neach, inclusive of all subscribed and unallocated shares. Accordingly, as of the Effective Date, all \noutstanding share capital commit ments of participating members in respect of their subscribed shares were \nconverted into EUR.  \n \nThe authorized capital stock of the Bank may be increased at such time and under such terms as may \nseem advisable.  \n \nThe Bank’s capital stock is divided into paid-in shares (fully paid and payable in installments) and callable \nshares. Payment for the paid -in shares subscribed to by members was made over a period of years in \naccordance with Article 6 of the Establishing Agreement for the initial capital raising purpose of the Bank, \nand as determined in advance by the Bank for capital increases (in the only capital increase of the Bank \nso far, the structure of payments specified was similar to the one in Article 6). The same Article states that \npayment of the amou nt subscribed to in respect of the callable shares is subject to call only as and when \nrequired by the Bank to meet its obligations.  \n \nUnder Article 37 of the Establishing Agreement any member may withdraw from the Bank by transmitting \na notice in writing t o the Bank at its Headquarters. Withdrawal by a member shall become effective and its \nmembership shall cease on the date specified in its notice, but in no event less than six months after such \nnotice is received by the Bank. However, at any time before th e withdrawal becomes finally effective, the \nmember may notify the Bank in writing of the cancellation of its notice of intention to withdraw. Under Article \n39 of the Establishing Agreement after the date on which a member ceases membership, it shall remain  \nliable for its direct obligations to the Bank, and also remain responsible for its contingent liabilities to the \nBank, incurred as of that date. No member has ever withdrawn its membership, nor has any ever indicated \nto the Bank it might do so. Were a mem ber to withdraw from the Bank, at the time a member ceases \nmembership, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of such a member’s shares by the Bank as part of \nthe settlement of accounts with such a member, and be able to impose conditions and set dates pursuant \nto the same Article 39 of the Establishing Agreement. Any amount due to the member for its shares shall \nbe withheld so long as the member, including its central bank or any of its agencies, has outstanding \nobligations to the Bank, which may, at th e option of the Bank, be applied to any such liability as it matures.  \n \nIf losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees or loans which were outstanding on the date when \na member ceased membership and the amount of such losses exceeds the amount of the  reserves \nprovided against losses on the date, the member concerned shall repay, upon demand, the amount by \nwhich the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced if the losses had been taken into account \nwhen the repurchase price was determined.  \n \nUnder Article 42 of the Establishing Agreement in the event of termination of the operations of the Bank, \nthe liability of members for the unpaid portion of the subscribed capital of the Bank shall continue until all \nclaims of creditors, including all co ntingent claims, have been discharged.  \n \nAll participating members had fully subscribed to the initial authorized share capital in accordance with \nArticle 5 of the Establishing Agreement. Subsequently, at the Sixth Annual Meeting of the Board of \nGovernors h eld on 6 June 2004 three Member States, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova requested a 50% \nreduction of their portion of subscribed capital, from 2% to 1% of the initial authorized capital and the BoG \napproved their request. On 5 October 2008 the new shares purs uant to the capital increase of the Bank \nwere offered in the same structure as the initial authorized share capital, in the amount of EUR 1.15 billion, \nand were fully subscribed by the Member States.  \n 67 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \nFurthermore, Azerbaij an also subscribed to the 3% of the initial authorized share capital that remained \nunallocated, after the above mentioned participation reduction, while Romania subscribed both to their \nallocation of new shares and to those that would have been allocated t o Georgia had it chosen to participate \nin the capital increase. This subscription process followed a decision taken by the BoG in December 2007 \nto triple the Bank’s authorized capital to EUR 3.45 billion and to double the subscribed capital to EUR 2.3 \nbillion, while leaving authorized capital of EUR 1.15 billion unallocated. On October 2011 the BoG approved \nthe request from Moldova for a 50% reduction of its portion of subscribed capital, from 1% to 0.5%, and \nthose shares were released to unallocated share capital.  \n \nThe above share capital is analyzed as follows:  \n \n \n \nPresented in EUR (000)  At \n31 December  \n2021 At \n31 December  \n2020 \nAuthorized share capital  \nLess: unallocated share capital*  3,450,000  \n(1,161,500)  3,450,000  \n(1,161,500)  \nSubscribed share capital  \nLess: shares not yet called  2,288,500  \n(1,601,950)  2,288,500  \n(1,601,950)  \nPaid-up share capital  \nAdvance against future call  686,550  \n- 686,550 \n- \nPaid -in share capital  686,550  686,550 \n \n* Shares available to new or existing Member States.  \n \nInitial Capital  \n \nIn accordance with paragraph 2 under Article 5 of the Establishing Agreement, the initially authorized \ncapital stock was subscribed by and issued to each Member as follows: 10% (EUR 115 million) fully paid \nand 20% (EUR 230 million) payable  by promissory notes or other obligations which were not negotiable \nand non -interest bearing in eight equal successive annual installments in the years 1998 to 2005.  \n \nCapital Increase  \n \nThe capital increase of EUR 1.15 billion is divided into EUR 345 millio n paid in capital and EUR 805 million \ncallable capital. Pursuant to the Board of Governors decision in October 2008, the EUR 345 million paid in \nportion is divided into 10% (EUR 115 million) fully paid shares in 2010 and 20% (EUR 230 million) payable \nshare s by promissory notes or other obligation issued by members in eight equal successive annual \ninstallments in the years 2011 to 2018. As of October 2011, the capital increase was reduced by EUR 11.5 \nmillion of the subscribed share capital, due to an approve d reduction by the BoG in participation by \nMoldova.  \n \nThe initial and capital increase that was issued is analyzed as follows:  \n \n \n \n \n \nPresented in EUR (000)  At \n31 December  \n2021 \nInitial  \ncapital  Capital  \nincrease   \nTotal  \nAuthorized share capital  \nLess: unallocated share capital  1,150,000  \n(34,500)  2,300,000  \n(1,127,000)  3,450,000  \n(1,161,500)  \nSubscribed share capital  \nLess: shares not yet called  1,115,500  \n(780,850)  1,173,000  \n(821,100)  2,288,500  \n(1,601,950)  \nPaid-up share capital  \nAdvance against future call 334,650  \n40 351,900  \n(40) 686,550  \n- \nPaid -in share capital  334,690  351,860  686,550  \n \n \n \n \n 68 \n  Notes to the Financial Statements  \n \n \nStatement of Subscriptions  \n \nA statement of capital subscriptions illustrating the number of shares and the amount subscribed by each \nmember is shown below, including their respective callable, payable and the amount paid.
